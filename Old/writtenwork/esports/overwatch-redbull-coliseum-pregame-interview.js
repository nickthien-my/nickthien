We haven't really changed our training schedule as some of us are still only part-timer. So there hasn't been huge changes to our training schedule but we get to see each other's faces now.</em><br><em>It helps a lot because we can see if each other's struggling or celebrate if someone is doing well.

How are you guys adapting to playing in front of a crowd?</strong><br><strong>OT:</strong> <em>While we try to keep our focus on the game itself, there are of course differences when playing at home and at a venue. We've got to adapt to the setup not being what we're used to, the distraction from the crowd and just being in a venue itself instead of being in our own homes at times.</em><br><em>But it's definitely something we look forward to if we have the aspiration to compete at an international level because we won't be playing against top world players in our pyjamas, we'll be staring them down face-to-face and we can't be intimidated.</em>",

Speaking of the international level, we can't help but notice that there aren't that many local teams springing up even after more than a year of Overwatch's release. Why do you think this is so?</strong><br><strong>OT:</strong> <em>It's definitely not growing as fast as we hoped, we would love to see more players take the plunge and be competitive in Overwatch. But we know that compared to other esports titles, it definitely has the highest level of investment. From the cost of the game to the cost of the equipment required to run the game competitively.</em><br><em>We hope to see more venues take Overwatch seriously to provide players with easy access to the game but sometimes changes take a while and we hope that these changes don't happen too late that people move on from Overwatch.</em>",
