    <p>As winners of the recent ieSF World Championship Malaysia Qualifier back in August, Team Rough House will be leaving to Busan next week to represent Malaysia in League of Legends and we opened our doors to; help coach the amateur team before they face&nbsp;against teams hailing from different parts of world. Australia, New Zealand, China, India, and Korea to name&nbsp;a few of the countries that will be participating in the tournament.</p>
    <p><strong>Could you guys give us a short introduction to yourselves?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Team Rough Life: </strong><em>We're Team Rough Life, we're a Malaysian League of Legends team that qualified for the ieSF in August. We found each other online, had passion for LoL and just formed a team.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Congratulations on qualifying for the ieSF, it must be pretty exciting for you guys?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>TRL: </strong><em>Thank you, we're really excited to go. We didn't really expect to qualify but it happened and we're just enjoying the ride. We were surprised to get a call from Fire Dragoon that they opened their doors for us to train.</em></p>
    <p><strong>Did you expect all this when you guys first got the call?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>TRL: </strong><em>I think we just expected that it was going just using the equipment in the office to play and that's it. We didn't expect to have a gaming house provided and best of all a coach! We were really surprised when we came in and we were told that we would be coached by the one and only Crowe!</em></p>
    <p><em>We've also been really taken care of. We were told that if we had any problems we could just contact them, but everything's been taken care of so well that we haven't found much problem. We could just focus on playing and not worry about anything else.</em></p>
    <p><strong>That's really good to hear, I'll talk to you guys again before you guys leave to see how you guys are doing Thank you.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>TRL: </strong><em>Thank you!</em></p>

        <p><u><strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team took part in the online <em>World Cyber Arena 2017 APAC OPEN QUALIFICATION</em> on Friday evening. In the first round of 128, the team had a bye and advanced to the next round where they would face fellow Malaysian team, <em>Virtual Genesis Esports</em>, in the round of 64. The team managed to beat VG, 16&ndash;10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that evening in the round of 32, the team went against Vietnamese team, <em>UTM </em><em>CS:GO</em>, one of the biggest professional esports team in Vietnam. UTM blew past the CSGO team and was eliminated from the qualifier with the final score of 8&ndash;16. The team finished in the Top 32 and is unable to qualify for the main WCA 2017 APAC event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>FIFA17</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the weekend, the <em>FIFA17</em> duo had two events. The first event was <em>Gamesbro</em>&#39;s<em> FIFA17 Tournament</em> that was held at <em>Gamesbro</em> on Saturday. <em>Amirul &quot;AmTuah&quot; Afandi</em> was sadly knocked out early in the top 32 by <em>Falcon Esports</em> representative, <em>KaizerHaz</em>, who was knocked out by another fellow <em>Falcon Esports</em> player in the next round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Boon Shin &quot;Shige&quot;</em> would see more action at <em>Gamesbro</em>, after the group stages. His first game was against <em>Prodigy FIFA Gaming</em>&#39;s <em>Ace</em>. <em>Shige</em> beats&nbsp;<em>Ace</em>, 5&ndash;3. In the round of 16, <em>Shige</em> would help his fellow teammate take back a win from <em>Falcon Esports</em> by beating their representative, <em>Dakwos</em>, 3&ndash;1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing his winning streak, <em>Shige</em> would next face <em>Kickers</em>&#39; <em>Abul</em>. Going 1&ndash;1 in normal time, they would head into the penalty shootout with <em>Shige</em> coming out on top and moving on to the semifinals. Shige had hoped to go 4 for 4 against the esports companies that are competing in <em>Gamesbro</em> by beating <em>Infinite Esports</em>&#39; <em>Nakata</em>. Sadly, <em>Shige</em> was unable to overcome the champion of the tournament. Losing to <em>Nakata</em>, 3&ndash;1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that lost, <em>Shige</em> was sent to the loser&#39;s final to compete for third place against <em>Prodigy</em>&#39;s <em>Sora</em>. <em>Shige</em> managed to defeat <em>Sora,</em>&nbsp;ultimately achieving the second runner-up position.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="360" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/18/gamesbro.jpg" width="640" />\r\n<figcaption><em>Shige </em>accepting the prize for 2nd runner-up position. Photo credit to <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/gamesbro.my">Gamesbro.my</a></em></figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Their next tournament at&nbsp;<em>Seven Legends Gaming Studio</em> on Sunday, <em>Shige </em>was sadly knocked out early on while <em>AmTuah</em> went on to be the champion of the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Overwatch</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team had an eventful two-days at <em>C2AGE X-treme 2017</em> at <em>HELP University, Subang 2 Campus</em>. On Saturday, the team only had one game against <em>5F1M</em> and won their first match in the tournament and advanced to the winner bracket finals on Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the winner bracket finals, the team went against <em>SoloQ Gaming</em>, who the team defeated last month during <em>Midnight Gaming</em>&#39;s <em>Jom Main! Overwatch Tournament</em>. So there is definitely a desire from the opposing team to overcome the team. The team managed to hold their ground and sent <em>SoloQ</em> to the loser&#39;s finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would not be the last time that the teams meet. As <em>SoloQ</em> proved their tenacity by beating <em>Malaysian Battlefield Team - Mixed Team</em> in the loser&#39;s finals and faced off against the team one more time in the grand finals. However, <em>SoloQ </em>was unable to find a winning solution for the <em>FDG </em>team and the team beat <em>SoloQ</em>, 3&ndash;0, and ended the day as the champions of the tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/18/overwatch_c2age.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>The Overwatch team. Champions of the C2AGE X-treme 2017 Overwatch Tournament.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, due to the team participating in this LAN tournament, they had to forfeit their match with <em>Xavier Esports</em> in the <em>ESL Open Division</em> due to scheduling, this drops the team down to 10th place.</p>	t	0.000876328038387432775	P	2017-07-18 18:48:19.865174+08	2017-07-18 19:00:01.001354+08	2017-07-18 19:00:00+08		117352408889462	10	9

    21	Realising the virtual football dream	Fire Dragoon Esports' FIFA player, Shige has gone through a long journey	Jeffery "Vyprex" Chan	4Website.jpg	470	1300	0.5x0.32		realising-virtual-football-dream	<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="430" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/28/shige-splash-final.jpg" width="1000" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">The phrase &ldquo;two is better than one&rdquo; has been used in many occasions and it stays true to its representation. In Fire Dragoon, a similar situation exist in its FIFA team, and it revolves&nbsp;around the duo, consisting of Lim &ldquo;Shige&rdquo; Boon Shin and Amirul &ldquo;AmTuah&rdquo; Afandi. Shige&#39;s story was anything but easy. Instead, it is one filled with passion, hard work, and never-ending perseverance </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">From humble beginnings</span></span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">There are esports personalities who instantly found their calling after months of grinding and playing the game but Shige&rsquo;s journey did not begin that way. &nbsp;Instead, it started when he was a mere 5 year old child. At that age, he spends his free time casually playing Pro Evolution Soccer (PES) with his siblings and cousins at home - and that, was how his interest in the game grew.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Things became slightly more serious after Shige&rsquo;s first tournament at the age of 10, where he managed to pull off an upset against peers and is crowned champions of a small local tournament. That ignited his competitive spirit and in order to seek more challenges, he&nbsp;shifted to FIFA 14 as it was a title with more tournaments in town. However, the transition to FIFA wasn&rsquo;t as smooth as he would have wanted. In the early stages of his FIFA journey, he was constantly outclassed by his opponent&rsquo;s skill and proficiency in the game.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="500" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/23/shige-gaming-1.jpg" width="1000" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">The first mini tournament he participated in The Mines resulted in a 0-6 and 0-5 stomp by his opponent. Despite so, Shige did not take the loss negatively. &ldquo;While many see losing negatively, I do not see it the same way. Personally, I learn and improve the most after being beaten by better players and it is through such losses; I became who I am today.&rdquo; he emphasized</span></span>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Shige stormed the FIFA community ever since, bagging multiple titles along the way and is often seen butting heads against his top tier players in Malaysia especially now-comrade AmTuah. Both of them were friendly rivals over the past 3 years and it peaked during the AGES 2016, where both of them played their hearts out in the grand finals&nbsp;of the FIFA 16 tournament. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Unfortunately, Shige lost the&nbsp;match against AmTuah in a penalty shootout. </span></span><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">&ldquo;The loss was painful as it was probably the biggest stage a FIFA tournament has ever had, but that is part and parcel of the competition. AmTuah and I were really close friends out of the game, so I was happy for him as well,&rdquo; expressed Shige.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Once rivals, now comrades.</span></span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="545" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/23/signing-amtuah.jpg" width="1000" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Early this April, Shige was brought in together with AmTuah to represent the Fire Dragoon FIFA squad. While it seemed appropriate to unite both champions of its own kind to form the most formidable lineup, the story of these two players has been an interesting one -&nbsp;to say the least.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Both players started their esports career during the same tournament and after multiple hurdles and challenges, they are now in the same organisation to play their role in building the esports industry in Malaysia. They would still be competing against each other in tournaments, but ultimately, Shige felt that having AmTuah as a teammate helps improve both of them as a player as well as an individual.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">&quot;We get to share our previous competitive experience and learn from each other&rsquo;s strength and weakness. In fact, we have specific training sessions to work on our weakness and to build on our strength,&rdquo; when asked of the benefit of playing together with AmTuah.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">The future remains unknown, but one can have faith that this dynamic duo will blossom in upcoming FIFA tournaments in Malaysia</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Joining the Dragoons.</span></span></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="563" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/28/featureplayer_shige280617.jpg" width="1001" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">In Fire Dragoon, Shige trains an average of 6 hours from 6PM to 12AM daily, after his day job in the organisation HQ together with his partner, AmTuah. His training routine would revolves around playing friendly matches filled with basic drills such as shooting, passing and dribbling. </span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">&ldquo;Basic drills may seem simple and boring for most players as everyone wants to dive straight into the game. However, the basics are exceptionally important in order to improve and be a better player,&rdquo; he&nbsp;mentioned when being asked of the importance of basic drills.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">Shige has been the player to watch in 2017 as he had won multiple tournaments organised by Geek Empire and Gamesbond. Despite so, Shige believes that it is just the beginning, as he would still need work hard to make his end goal a reality - the FIFA Interactive World Cup.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12px">While there are a lot of moments in his esports career is worth highlighting, the one he liked the most was in the JP Gamifest FIFA 17 Cup in Singapore. &quot;To attend the tournament, I drove alone for almost 6 hours&nbsp;to Singapore and was one of the two Malaysian who participated in the tournament. Against all odds, I managed to take down the defending champion, Kickers.Ash in the quarterfinals and eventually became the champions of the tournament.&quot; &nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12px">&quot;I have high hopes for 2017 and is looking forward t</span></span><span style="font-size:12px"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif">o work my way through with Fire Dragoon to put the Malaysian flag in the international stage</span></span><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12px">,&quot; he added.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:Tahoma,Geneva,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:12px">Follow Shige @ <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fdg.shige" target="_blank">Facebook</a>&nbsp;</span></span></p>	t	0.00350265639453085052	P	2017-06-23 17:15:37.944772+08	2017-07-27 18:41:37.622462+08	2017-06-23 16:13:41+08		346754265760116	6	1

Comic Fiesta is one of the largest and longest-running animation, comics and games (ACG) event in South-East Asia. So what better way to enjoy watching the finals than by&nbsp;having lots of booths on ACG and its&nbsp;merchandise that you can buy and bring home in the same event!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back to talking about the Legacy Series, the teams that were involved were <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/N2d-MxDL30Z2kOCB92T_TcKI5acTQTcNoyPZCAFfMwHpqj_T5mLrGF_BsrMZDfms3psltFefVJR3XYg4gAE2H8yOlWpcBzakJbrjLnYIuu-YejX0BGbYgo9MTDUC5SYUnBii5Mgc">Nothing to Lose 2.0</a> (NTL), <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nRd6pNs1rigMDfR3r5_TswscnjtRtHsCMe9I_e5WQcCCXiEK6njdAwklcCBGfmPq4cqGZ7SwQUyNSq7XWcHlhZ8rRbDruknRGSjgT1i_PWJ1w4twVZVPO6TpgmUL1VpdTTZuif9k">Circular Motion</a> and <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_0fJjqJPUvTePkO4kb42Nf1B3t6-A8GCOrUIRCUk1R4WyR4QOP0OrMesoUqigJANPjAHKlSahDZMeapB0cNCuJvHl5It1wbsfIqKlAtvAt_b1U-ixdQTNfWMi5r9fmFu2D6o9GLj">Washed Up Mid</a>. The semifinal and grand finals were set in a Best of 3 format. Washed Up Mid defeated Circular Motion in the semi, with Nothing to Lose redeeming themselves from the Loser Bracket&nbsp;by beating Circular Motion right after that to propel the team into the finals against Washed Up Mid. &nbsp;In the end, Washed Up Mid emerged <a href="http://challonge.com/ew52pvf1">victorious</a> as the champion of the Legacy Series after 3 games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Fire Dragoon LoL team had fun going down to the event, meeting up with the fans from the #FireNation group and taking pictures with them as their weekend leisure activity. It also became a team bonding session for the League team by going to an ACG event. Not only that, the team get to see other teams in action from a spectator standpoint rather than as a group&nbsp;that&nbsp;will compete on stage and being able to get the feeling of a LAN tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, Garena did a very good job in organizing the amateur tournament finals in KLCC. Let us hope that there are more coming in for the professional scene of League of Legends in Malaysia.</p>	t	0.00331982857022926695	P	2017-12-21 18:13:56.367256+08	2017-12-21 19:00:01.544096+08	2017-12-21 19:00:00+08		133083407479066	1	18

    86	First Light - LoC Qualifiers	Our coach shares the League team's experience before the Legion of Champions began.	Luqman "Crowe" Abdullah	Luqman_Header-01_F2rXp07.jpg	1776	5334	0.5x0.5		first-light-loc-qualifiers	<p>I remember the night before our first players arrived, I could barely sleep. I was so excited to get started on the new players and get to know them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that everyone was under our roof, our first task stood ahead of us; the League of Champions qualifier was taking place that weekend and it would serve as Fire Dragoon&rsquo;s maiden voyage for the 2017-2018 season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Honestly, when I heard that we had to play in the LOC qualifiers I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect, but I was sure that we weren&rsquo;t going to start coaching the players until everyone was here.&rdquo; explained Fire Dragoon&rsquo;s Head Coach, Jordan Corby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Since Arashi arrived a day later than everyone else, it didn&rsquo;t make sense to start coaching part of the team that week and then have to get Arashi to catch up from the very beginning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, as the assistant coach, I agreed with the decision, but a part of me really wanted to come out of the gate with a polished and convincing victory. And I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not the only one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I want to go through this tournament without losing a single match!&rdquo; proclaimed Jonathan &ldquo;Xare&rdquo; Chan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We arrived on the first day of competition to the offices with one thought in mind, &ldquo;Can we really win LOC without having had any time to practice at all?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Remember guys, winning LOC is not the goal of this season, winning the Malaysian league is the goal, win or lose, understand that this doesn&rsquo;t change anything&rdquo; was the message from Jordan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We played through the first two rounds of competitions without dropping a single game, taking out teams Team Tanah Malayu Gaming and RoughLife in a convincing fashion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A part of me was very relieved, after all, best of ones are dicey by definition and all it would take is one cheesy strategy to end our run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next week featured matches against former TLC MY participant, Climax in a best of three series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This match serves mostly as a test to see where we are as a team&rdquo; Jordan expressed the day of the match. &ldquo;Remember what you&rsquo;ve learned and play with purpose!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We had had some time that week to go over a few concepts with the team, but nothing so dense that we expected a massive improvement in play from Week 1 to Week 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team did not disappoint however, dispatching of Team Climax in a 2-0 victory. The next team we would face would be Orange Esports, led by top laner Rexion and former teammate to Arashi and Xeno, BigJazz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though the team did not play their best series, we emerged from the match victorious, taking out Orange Esports 2-0 and landing us a place in the LOC Qualifiers Finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Celebrations are clearly in order!&rdquo; proclaimed Camou, our team manager as we piled into the car to go and get a well deserved victory lunch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being in the finals gives us an opportunity to not only play in front of a live crowd at a venue but also proves that the roster that we have assembled has all the potential we believed it could have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Obviously being in the finals is pretty cool, but I&rsquo;m really happy that the team is improving so quickly&rdquo; Atup pointed out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also pretty cool that I get to play in the finals against my old team, so there&rsquo;s that.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think that we played against some decent teams, and obviously some random ones, so I think that so far the team has performed as expected for a pro team,&rdquo; added Xare. &ldquo;However I also think that while winning this would be really good, the real test lies ahead of us. LCM and GPL are the objectives that we are focused on and proving our strength in LOC is only the beginning.&rdquo;</p>	t	0.00471166445208345049	P	2017-12-29 15:39:15.162097+08	2017-12-29 15:39:15.162135+08	2017-12-29 15:38:58+08	57873781-abdf-456a-b893-8f261506a2aa		1	18

Could you give our readers a quick introduction about yourself?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>My name is Matthew Chan. Most people know me as a &quot;</em><em>Camou</em><em>&quot;, which is short for &quot;Camouflage&quot;. People preferred my shorter in-game name so I stuck with it. I&#39;m from Selangor and a graduate of Mass Comm. from the UK.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/18/camou_profileupclose.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did you get into </strong><strong>esports</strong><strong>?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>I was inspired to pursue a career in </em><em>esports</em><em>&nbsp;because&nbsp;I watched the Championship Gaming Series when I was 12 years old. I&#39;ve been involved with League of Legends specifically for 6 years now. I&#39;ve been everything from a player, to a </em><em>shoutcaster</em><em>, to an analysis, a coach and now a manager. I was pretty good at League back in the day but I decided to focus on finishing my education before making a return to </em><em>esports</em><em>. But even after all this time I still have a love for </em><em>esports</em><em> in my heart.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why did you choose to join Fire Dragoon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C:</strong><em> I was initially hesitant at first, although I&#39;ve been involved in the </em><em>esports</em><em> scene here and there independently. I wasn&#39;t sure if working for a company here in Malaysia, I would be able to make as big of an impact as if I was somewhere else. There was a lot of convincing but I saw that FDG was doing all the right moves and felt that I could help out the League side of things and decided to give it a shot.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>While my family supports my career choice, I still feel that there&#39;s a lot of improvements left to go for </em><em>esports</em><em>. We&#39;re still not at the point where it&#39;s a viable career that people still feel like it&#39;s taking a big risk to pursue a career in it. I want to continue paving the way so that the next person won&#39;t feel the need to ask himself or herself whether or not it&#39;s a risk to jump into the </em><em>esports</em><em> arena.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="1280" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/18/camou_profile.jpg" width="960" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your methodology for&nbsp;managing a team?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>I try to get to know everyone at a personal level, to make everyone feel more comfortable and at home. Once we&#39;re acquainted, then we start discussing where we plan on heading. I want to try and get everyone on the same page before moving forward. I want everyone to move in the same direction, vision, and goals. When everyone believes in the same vision, then everyone will pull&nbsp;their own weight and do&nbsp;their best.&nbsp; To me what I feel&nbsp;my role as a manager is, it is to make sure that the team would be able to function without me.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your vision for the team?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>C:</strong> <em>To me, I want my FDG team to be a formidable name in Malaysia. &nbsp;Once we&#39;ve made a name for ourselves at home then we&#39;ll start making a name worldwide.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="1280" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/18/camou_mid.jpg" width="960" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thank you for your time and good luck in fulfilling that vision with the team.</strong></p>	t	0.00394402403565297013	P	2017-08-18 15:45:41.992665+08	2017-08-18 23:12:14.490862+08	2017-08-18 17:30:00+08		263870817439656	1	9

Last year, Malaysia had the privilege of hosting the Grand Finals at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre but this weekend, the Malaysian teams will be kicking off their journey into the ROG Masters at 1Utama.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ewkWo0TsjGw" width="100%"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the stories leading up to the tournament that you, the #FireNation should get to know before the battle starts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Counter Strike: Global Offensive</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="601" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/MPYNpdmXmZP1n0bYxivXSiFUo3JKociwgUUt25buUtkiJbJXbb21qU9aT220cbz2_eZMF3dJl3BTxWo3SRgLyhudO4-hwLFLoV4kpS0U9deb0UWbuya2kE7VWvMvLV9PxkJwmlq4" width="602" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After <a href="https://www.firedragoon.com/articles/44/strength-dragoons">securing their ticket</a> to the <em>ieSF</em><em> World Championship</em> in Busan, South Korea and the Redbull Coliseum Main Event, the FDG CS:GO team is now putting their sights on scoring the hat-trick with a trip to the Regional Finals in China. However, with the team lineups for the ROG Masters, it is not going to be an easy task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several teams to look out for during the tournament, and one of them comes with the name of <em>JYP Gaming</em>, better known in the past as <em>MVP Karnal</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>JYP Gaming</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Former team of the FDG&nbsp;CS:GO coach <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=666700930181846"><em>aimaNNN</em></a>, JYP Gaming was the hallmark of excellence for the local CS:GO community representing the country in tournaments such as the <em>World Cyber Arena 2016 (WCA)</em> and <em>World Electronic Sports Game 2016 (WESG)</em>. They have since undergone multiple roster swaps and has been on a hiatus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, having been under the radar since May 2017, it is definitely exciting to see what they can showcase in the tourney. Coach aimaNNN would probably be excited about this homecoming match, but due to how the brackets are allocated, it will only take place if both teams end up clashing against each other at the later stage of the tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Orange Esports</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Orange Esports had been one of the titans in the Malaysia CS:GO community for the past few months, and played with the FDG several times. With the score between the two teams settled at 2-1, it would be a treat to see who comes out as the victors in the ROG Masters this weekend if both FDG and Orange Esports were to clash.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both teams would be meeting in the semi-finals, assuming that they both win Match 1 of the tournament against Sacrifice and Virtual Genesis, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Dota 2</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="601" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/MP2SRn2g4ZtBy1jDkeXU3c71pJUH7g-8aEIhQAnCQNmBWc99cCKD082NRx4JsPKItNdm2dN-xQYPhyJd6h_ZZ1I8hHIZArSmnwnee8Zn-UnlUkbyPN52ZyJF3sOyAjYLTrvNLf2F" width="602" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end of <em>The International 7</em> marked the coming of major roster shuffle and with FDG, it was the same. The team managed to bring in the likes of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/343Dota/"><em>Adam &ldquo;</em></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/343Dota/"><em>adam</em></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/343Dota/"><em>&rdquo; Shah</em></a> and<em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AhJit-2004881129734926/">Lai &ldquo;AhJit&rdquo; Jay Son</a></em> into its ranks and while it is too early to determine if the roster swap is a success, the squad has made its mark over the week in the StarLadder i-League Invitationals and ProDota SEA Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the team is still relatively new and inconsistent - to say the least. In their <a href="https://www.firedragoon.com/articles/46/dota-teams-first-rumble"><em>Malaysia Esports League (MESL)</em> finals match</a>, the team lost 0-2 to one of the teams participating in the ROG Masters, <em>818&rsquo; Reverse Heaven (RH)</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>818&#39; Reverse Heaven</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Champions of the <em>Logitech Play Advanced Tournament</em> and the <em>MESL Selangor Qualifiers</em>, RH is not a team to be taken lightly. Although the Johorian team have not shown up in major tournaments yet, they have been bagging multiple titles in local tournaments and would be setting their sights towards the ROG Masters this weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the debut of the newly formed FDG lineup, RH swept the team 2-0 in the finals convincingly and would be looking to replicate their success. However, it is fair to say that the FDG Dota 2 squad would not let it happen again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Beginning</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The roster of <em>New Beginning (NB)</em> seeks to breathe life with veterans of the scene namely <em>YamateH</em>, <em>Nj</em> and <em>kYxY</em> who were part of powerhouse teams in previous years. Paired together with young talents such as <em>Cheng &lsquo;vtFaded&rsquo; Jia Hao</em>, the team is filled with potential and is looking to be the dark horse of the tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the recent ProDota SEA Cup, NB played against FDG and the series was tied at 1-1 after taking Game 1. Both teams would want to settle the score, but that would have to wait - at least until the upper bracket finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the previous Selangor Cyber Games featuring mainly professional <em>League of Legends</em>, the ROG Masters turn their heads and feature&nbsp;the best Dota 2 and CS:GO teams in town. Thus, make sure to drop by <em>1Utama</em> from 15th-17th September 2017 to catch the match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;ll be some giveaways going on from FDG, so be sure to drop by and support the team, <a href="https://www.firedragoon.com/articles/43/fire-dragoon-merchandise-giveaway">and to win some FDG goodies too!</a></p>	t	0.0013785247289081978	P	2017-09-14 19:37:47.498473+08	2017-09-14 19:37:47.49852+08	2017-09-14 19:30:00+08	b8dc40f4-ef21-4ad6-98fa-144edbbdb7dc		3	9

However, we realized we still have much room for improvement after gaining international exposure during our overseas circuit. We then decided to try out &ldquo;aimaNNN&rdquo; and &quot;acAp&quot; as stand-ins as we felt they would be able to bring our roster closer to achieving our goal of a world class team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is what our CSGO manager NG has to say:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These players provide an immense pool of international experience and game sense, are very disciplined and dedicated in training sessions and are critical and adaptable in identifying issues and creating solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe these players will be able to bring the winds of change in providing a positive momentum to a successful future. They have the potential to bring our team to a whole new level and dominate closer to being a world class team. Hopefully we can see them officially play under the Fire Dragoon banner in the near future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you and please continue supporting us.

    84	Igniting A Fire: Our New Roster	Crowe sits down with Matthew "Camou" Chan to talk about the idea behind building the Fire Dragoon League Roster.	Luqman "Crowe" Abdullah	Luqman_Header-01.jpg	1776	5334	0.5x0.5		igniting-fire-our-new-roster	<p>When building a team there are a ton of elements to consider. Not only do the members of the team need to be able to perform together in game, but they also need to be able to get along outside of it and sometimes personalities can be hard to match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Malaysia, the talent pool isn&rsquo;t as big when compared to other regions, meaning that in order to yield the best possible team, we needed to be thorough when researching the players we chose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I had to make sure that the management branch of the team was solid first.&rdquo; explained team manager Matthew &ldquo;Camou&rdquo; Chan. &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s important that all players are talented, but more important is that the team is run correctly to get the most out of them&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Camou wasted no time in bringing in coaching staff, including Jordan Corby who was previously coaching teams in the LMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With a coach like Jordan at the helm, I felt that things would run as smoothly as possible, now I just needed to bring in players that I thought could benefit the most from his tutelage.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Chan twins Jonathan (Xare) and Joshua (Ribenamania) were the only players that remain from the previous split&rsquo;s 6th place team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The twins are both very ambitious players and they have been among the very best in Malaysia for a long time. When it comes to problem solving in the game they are very smart, so I thought they&rsquo;d be a strong veteran presence for the younger players coming in.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With solid options at mid and marksman locked in, Camou then reached out to 4mod&rsquo;s previous top laner Khairul &ldquo;Atup&rdquo; Amirin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Atup is extremely hungry and was the most interested in joining Fire Dragoon. He was more than aware of all the challenges that joining FDG would present but ensured me that he was willing to work as hard as he could to meet the requirements that I laid out for him.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next Camou reached out to two members of Nirvana Gaming, Arashi and Xeno at Jungle and Support respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Arashi was simply the best choice available. I&rsquo;ve always viewed him as very talented but also very raw and I felt that with the right coaching, he could develop into a powerful jungler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xeno was kind of the obvious choice. Not only did he already have a good existing relationship with Arashi, but he was also one of most up and coming players in our scene&rdquo; explained Camou.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team has been together for a few weeks but they are already showing signs of growth, with dominant showings the first two weeks of the League of Champions series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So far, the team has really shown a lot of growth in a very short period of time. Their first week in LOC they had only scrimmed once and they had already started to develop chemistry. I just can&rsquo;t wait to see how they perform in the finals, and in the upcoming League of Legends Championship Malaysia.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Fire Dragoon lineup may only be in its infancy, but they are already emerging as a new dominant force in Malaysia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just very happy to see everything is going so smoothly. If we just work to be better everyday, I have the utmost faith that we can achieve great success.&rdquo;</p>	t	0.00265477000634677758	P	2017-12-21 16:42:04.421107+08	2017-12-21 16:43:52.559221+08	2017-12-21 16:43:41+08		171265120140403	1	18
    16	FDG Gathering	A short meet and greet among the players as well as a talk on sports psychology.	Nicholas Thien	FDG_Internal_Day_v2.JPG	640	1280	0.49x0.43		fdg-gathering	<p><span style="font-size:16px">Last weekend we had a few representatives from Primal High Performance Consulting (PHP), a company specializing in consulting for sports athletes, to give our players a short introduction into sports psychology. There&#39;s a hesitation even to this day, to call esports, an actual category in the wider context of sports. And this isn&#39;t even only just from the general public&#39;s perspective, but from a player&#39;s perspective as well. Many times players would just consider what they are doing as playing games and from that a mindset would form that what their doing is just a game that there would be little to no stakes involved. But as esports starts to become more widely accepted worldwide as a form of competition. Games stop being just about the games and involve a whole lot more.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">Hence, it was a good opportunity as we finalized the last of our team members to bring everyone together to set a clear goal for the company and the players. As an esports company, our main goal is to be competitive and to win games. But whether or not we do so convincingly is a different story. Results can only speak so much if on the surface everyone seems to get by the skin of their teeth. While it&#39;s good to be competent in game, it&#39;s also good to be confident and presentable off-screen as well. Making the jump from your bedrooms or the cyber cafe to the arenas and stadiums doesn&#39;t just mean playing the same game but in a different venue but a complete different playing field and rules.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/08/fdg_internal_day_jack-neo.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>PHP representative <em>Maradona</em>, giving us some insight on how his team has helped other sports athletes.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">Players are no longer competing only for themselves but for their respective teams and company, they now carry the burden of being the public face of not only the company but the sponsors and partners they represent. While some are able to weather the pressures of being in the public, many are not. Many are not regularly exposed to the limelight or have the training to be accustomed to it and this affects the performance of the players whether they realize it or not. Players choking at crucial moments that cost the team games. An inability to capitalize on a mistake that an opponent team made. Or a lack of focus and self-doubt as a player beat himself over an easy mistake that he&#39;s unable to recover from. A player could be in peak physical shape but a sharp and strong mind is what is required to win even against impossible odds.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">It was enlightening as well as encouraging to hear from the PHP&#39;s representatives that they, as well as their peers in the field, have taken a serious interest in esports as a very viable industry. It not only helps us to reaffirm what we&#39;ve known all along that we&#39;re working at the forefront of this industry but also gives us the confidence to continue to breaking new ground. A lot of blood, sweat and tears went into starting this company and it feels good to finally see the seeds that we&#39;ve sewn come into fruition. In the end of the day, we&#39;re not doing all this for ourselves. While some might feel that a monopoly in this industry is good, competition is what brings out the best throughout the whole industry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:16px">At the end of the day, with all the pomp and circumstances of a burgeoning industry. There&#39;s a risk of losing sight of what it&#39;s all about. Are we just another wannabe that&#39;s jumping on to the hype train or are we going to be a serious contender? Is our goal to chase the&nbsp;endorsements or selling merchandise? No, esports has to be about the competition and it&#39;s our jobs to help grow the industry so that there will always be fresh competition not only for us to compete with but for everyone out there to enjoy watching.</span></p>	t	0.00137695327764160609	P	2017-06-08 17:47:34.95607+08	2017-07-03 23:36:38.811603+08	2017-06-08 18:00:00+08		322273831536620	11	1
    80	Reforging Fire Dragoon	Jordan Corby's Path to Fire Dragoon Esports.	Luqman "Crowe" Abdullah	Luqman_Header-01.jpg	1776	5334	0.52x0.52		reforging-fire-dragoon	<p>Jordan Corby vigilantly watches over his team as they take to the rift for scrims. His eyes dart around the screen measuring their decisions and analyzing their gameplay. He scribbles notes in his pad while replaying a sequence over and over, breaking them down into digestible terms for his players to understand in their post game review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A lot of people seem to think that coaching is mostly about teaching, and while I do believe that there is teaching in coaching, I think my job is more a matter of guiding the players to the way they should be thinking about situations, not just explaining why they are wrong.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Breaking things down from behind the scenes is something that Jordan is all too accustomed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I got my start in music when I was 7 years old, I remember my first performance was when I was 13. To me, back then it was such a big deal playing in front of anyone and it inspired me to start my own band&rdquo;, he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The thing I noticed about being in a band is that most people aren&rsquo;t really willing to put in the amount of work or money into it as I was. Most bands in the United States always have one guy who basically does all the dirty work, and that was usually me when it came to music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his stint in music, Jordan wrote LoL related articles in which he would analyse various LoL professional teams, and one team in Taiwan took notice of his critical analysis of their play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I was trash talking Machi 17 saying things like they&rsquo;re so bad and they have no idea how to play the game and their owner reached out to me like &ldquo;Hey you seem like you know what you&rsquo;re talking about, wanna coach our team? I had been working with other teams in the past, but that was my first real coaching position.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Jordan made a significant impact on the growth of the teams he was a part of, he felt that some challenges limited his ability to really bring the team to their full potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When I was in Taiwan, one of the hardest things was just the fact that I couldn&rsquo;t really communicate with the teams due to language and cultural barriers. So when I started looking for a job, I wanted to be sure that I was going somewhere where I could have a real influence within the team.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having had the opportunity to make multiple connections in Korea, Europe, North America and even some Wildcard teams, Jordan credits a lot of his decision to leave Taiwan and join Fire Dragoon to his ability to not only communicate with his players (whom all speak English) but also to the FDG staff who contacted him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When Vyprex (Jeffery) first reached out to me, I just kept thinking there is no way this team is actually serious about bringing in a North American coach with my level of experience, but they continuously reassured me that they were willing to go all in with me, and that was what ultimately swayed my decision to come to Malaysia. Well, that and Veki. I remember how much he used to rant about Malaysia, so I came to see for myself.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jordan joins FDG as a head coach and will be supplemented by myself and Matthew &ldquo;Camou&rdquo; Chan both of whom are established in Malaysian esports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;So far, I feel like Fire Dragoon&rsquo;s fairly well run. On my first day in, I mentioned that the LoL room was set up pretty poorly and two weeks later, we&rsquo;ve improved the setup massively. I can pretty much run things the way I know how and that&rsquo;s all I really wanted in a team.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fire Dragoon starts their Season 8 journey in 2018, a challenge that Jordan can&rsquo;t wait to experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With regards to this year, I just think that as long as we focus on getting better every single day, that it&rsquo;ll be an exciting year for FDG and Malaysia. I&rsquo;m also pretty excited to play against Veki since he is my former colleague, so that&rsquo;ll be pretty fun too!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>	t	0.00246567689441434682	P	2017-12-14 18:34:01.157599+08	2017-12-14 19:20:32.368616+08	2017-12-14 19:00:00+08		1596465420399604	1	18

    31	The 9K Mindset	In less than year, 'AlaCrity - has made significant waves in the Dota 2 community. What drives him to achieve so much?	Nicholas Thien	FDG_playerfeature_alacrity.jpg	470	1300	0.5x0.5		9k-mindset	<p>Throughout human history, man has been obsessed with the &lsquo;chase&rsquo;. Something that gives a man purpose and drive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Dota 2</em>&rsquo;s <em>MatchMaking Rank (MMR)</em> has been that purpose and drive for many players. A perfect convergence of obsession and technology. The additional inclusion of a leaderboard that tracks the players and provides a list of the highest ranked players in their respective region. This began a chase amongst millions of players to show that they are the best <em>Dota 2</em> player in their respective regions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/19/feature-player_alacrity-2.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And one of those players who can boast being on top is <em>Vincent &ldquo;&lsquo;AlaCrity -&rdquo; Hiew Teck Yoong</em>. Only 20 years old, the young Johorian managed to surpass the 9K milestone in early July 2017, and as of the time of writing is currently the second ranked player in the SEA division. And what keeps him going is the &lsquo;chase&rsquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Early on in his gaming career, the only thing in <em>&#39;AlaCrity -</em>&rsquo;s sights was to enjoy the game. Content to play anywhere as long as he could play. This definitely informed his current playstyle as someone who takes risks, juking in and out of the opposing team&rsquo;s combat lines, surprising his enemies when a more conservative player would stay in their safe zones.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="360" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/19/alacrity_mineski-x.jpg" width="640" />\r\n<figcaption><em>&#39;AlaCrity -</em> with his previous teammates.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>But things took a turn when <em>Valve </em>introduced their <em>MMR </em>system in early 2014, for a lot of people including AlaCrity, it changed the game from mere casual competition to actual numbers that showed how much better a player was to another. And this lit a fire within <em>&#39;AlaCrity -</em>to be one of the best Dota 2 players in Malaysia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Having a higher MMR, gets you noticed by team scouts,&rdquo; says <em>&#39;AlaCrity -</em>as he recounts his time playing for professional teams in the past year. Names like <em>Mineski-X</em>, <em>Mineski-MY</em> and <em>Napo</em> are some of the team names that crosses his lips, some of the big name <em>Dota 2</em> teams here in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/19/alacrity_invoker.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption><em>&#39;AlaCrity -&nbsp;</em>using his favorite in-game <em>Dota 2</em> hero &#39;<em>Invoker</em>&#39;.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>However, just having a desire to win is not enough for you to break through the 4K rank, much less the 5K and each subsequent rank after, as the higher you go the more skilled the players that you are matched up against become. <em>&#39;AlaCrity -&nbsp;</em>continues to train every day, both in team games and solo queue. To him, it&#39;s his belief that &ldquo;talent doesn&rsquo;t make you a better player, it&rsquo;s hard work and consistency that makes you a better player.&rdquo; He enjoys playing the game even after playing professionally while many would feel burnt out due to the pressure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of pressure for me to improve, playing with players like <em>Mushi </em>taught me to thrive under pressure and to up my game.&rdquo; With newfound recognition from his peers, <em>AlaCrity -&nbsp;</em>hasn&rsquo;t let it all go to his head. While there will be others who see him now as a potential target at tournaments and online. He is keeping his focus on one game at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="360" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/19/alacrity_mineski-x_002.jpg" width="640" />\r\n<figcaption><em>&#39;AlaCrity -</em>&nbsp;(back) playing with his previous teammates.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>But he does express a desire not to be known as just a good solo player but as someone who is capable of winning titles with a team as well. With his eyes set on the next big regional tournament and one day competing on the big stage at The International. Outside of tournaments, his next personal achievement is to surpass fellow Malaysian <em>Dota 2</em> player and midlaner <em>Zheng &quot;MidOne&quot; Yeik Nai</em>, who in the same week of made news of passing the 10K MMR milestone. While he&rsquo;s enjoying the limelight that he&rsquo;s currently getting, what&rsquo;s important to him is what happens in-game. Reiterating that a high MMR doesn&rsquo;t really matter in the game if your team is not working well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&#39;<em>Alacrity -</em>&rsquo;&nbsp;assures us, that he&#39;s not given up on his &lsquo;chase&rsquo; anytime soon. Whether it be the next 10K or for the next tournament win.

Jeffery Chan	CSGO_Header.jpg	768	1920	0.5x0.5		csgo-statement	<blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>During the weekend, our&nbsp;CS:GO&nbsp;team participated in the&nbsp;B5&nbsp;Battle Arena&nbsp;CS:GO&nbsp;Online Qualifier and eventually dropped out of the tournament in the Round of 8 against Exodus&nbsp;Striatus&nbsp;15-19 due to some major technical issues. As we received questions from the fans on the matter, we would like to clarify and clear the rumours of the happenings during the match.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The match started out pretty well for the team as we managed to take a&nbsp;4-2&nbsp;lead, which&nbsp;was halted&nbsp;by an abrupt disconnection from&nbsp;Clickzai-&nbsp;in the middle of the match - and this was the beginning of the horror for the team. Key players took turns getting disconnected, and dropped off the server. Both teams had to use their pause to wait for our players to reconnect into the game and after multiple&nbsp;disconnections, both teams ended up using all the pauses given for our players to reconnect (each team is given 3 pauses, lasting for 30 seconds each).&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>There were no marshals&nbsp;or admins in the game, thus our coach reached out to the organiser to seek for help. What happened next was that the marshal&nbsp;telling us that the issue was not because of the server, but caused by our own internet connection. However, this couldn&#39;t have been the case as our League of Legends team is playing with the same connection, but did not face any of this disconnection problem.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>With nothing that could be done, we played on but the disconnection got worse. We requested for the match be paused in order for us to solve the issue because we have 3 different ISP registered in our office which we are able to use&nbsp;interchangeably. All the team needed was a simple pause so that we can investigate and rectify the issue (restarting router, changing ISP, etc) but yet, being one of the most basic function in online tournaments, the pause did not happen.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Our players ended up playing&nbsp;approximately&nbsp;10 rounds with 1 or 2 man down, slowly giving up our lead, and ultimately played to a 15-15 score to force an overtime. During the OT round,&nbsp;D4V41&nbsp;was disconnected&nbsp;from the server for 3 consecutive&nbsp;rounds, with&nbsp;Taz&nbsp;being disconnected during the&nbsp;finalround. That ultimately sealed the match and we eventually dropped out of the tournament.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>It was frustrating, especially to our players because they really want to repay the faith and support given to the team, but were not able to deliver because of such issues. For everyone who are constantly supporting the team, thank you and sorry that we couldn&#39;t deliver when it matters.&nbsp;</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>However, we&#39;ll be back stronger - so keep calm and continue supporting the team #TEAMFDG</blockquote>\r\n</blockquote>	t	0.00525666118854502089	P	2017-06-20 18:31:27.938694+08	2017-07-03 23:35:59.286433+08	2017-06-20 18:30:00+08		805368589626427	8	1

The <em>MOBA</em> teams have their work cut out for them, facing tough competition both from within and outside of Malaysia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><em><strong>League of Legends</strong></em></u></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/28/wwu_20170628_lol.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>FDG vs. eE</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Fire Dragoon League of Legends</em> team had two matches during week 4 of <em>The Legends Circuit MY 2017 Group Stage</em>. They went up against <em>4moD</em> on Friday night, resulting in a draw with 4moD winning the first game and on Saturday afternoon, the team went against <em>Eternity Esport</em> but was defeated 0 to 2.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming off a 4 game winning streak, hopes were high during the week that at least one of the two matches from last week&rsquo;s TLC MY 2017 Group Stage would have been a win to secure a spot in the playoffs but the roller coaster of emotions continue&nbsp;in TLC MY 2017 as the top 6 rankings continue to fluctuate without any of the teams managing to break away from the pack other than <em>Kuala Lumpur Hunters</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the teams so close in point totals, we won&rsquo;t know the outcome of the team until the very end of the group stages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><em><strong>Dota 2</strong></em></u></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/28/wwu_20170628_dota2.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>FDG vs. &nbsp;EVOS</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Participating in two <em>Open Qualifiers</em> over the week, the <em>Fire Dragoon Dota 2</em> team was unfortunately unable to qualify for the <em>Main Qualifiers</em> of <em>The International 2017</em>. They made it up to the round of 32 in the first group and managed to breach the top 8 in the second group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walking into a literal lion&rsquo;s den is the FDG Dota 2 team, with every team hungry for a chance in the spotlight that is TI 17. It would be a tall ask for any team to go against the best of the best of the SEA region. It was a gruelling marathon with matches played back to back as soon as the teams were ready to go. With a single elimination format that necessitated teams to think quickly on their feet and adjust to what their opponents were throwing at them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it was disappointing that the team didn&rsquo;t manage to qualify and move onto the next round, it was great experience going against teams with a variety of makeups from all over Asia. But with all things Dota 2, there&rsquo;s little time to rest and lick their wounds before the next tournament will come around the corner.</p>	t	0.000740444566086888778	P	2017-06-28 13:55:43.590068+08	2017-07-03 23:35:42.237207+08	2017-06-28 18:00:00+08		456248528077023	10	1

Nicholas Thien	FDG_KITAMEN_HEADER.jpg	500	1300	0.28x0.43		kitamen-legends-fifa-17-tournament-recap	<p>Last weekend, our two <em>FIFA 17</em> players played off against each other in the grand finals of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1401143979963025/"><em>Kitamen Legends FIFA 17 Tournament</em></a>. It was one of the main gaming events held during the <a href="http://www.vax.asia/"><em>Visual Arts Expo 2017</em></a> which took place at the <em>Shah Alam Convention Center</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/25/fdg_kitamen_fifa_players.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>Players competing against each other during their group stages.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The tournament started on Saturday morning by whittling down the 64 competitors to the 32 who will be competing in the elimination rounds on Sunday. It was fortuitous that our two <em>FIFA 17</em> players were placed in separate branches or else we wouldn&#39;t have&nbsp;gotten the&nbsp;chance to see these two titans facing off against each other in the finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the duo made their way through to the front of the pack, competition continued to be fierce but there was little doubt that we would be seeing a matchup between our two <em>FIFA 17</em> players. It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve last seen these two go head-to-head in a tournament setting, so it was a treat that doesn&rsquo;t come around often enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/25/kitamen_fifa_interview.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption><em>Shige </em>and <em>AmTuah</em> during their finals match.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/fdg.shige/">Boon Shin &quot;Shige&quot;</a></em> with his Manchester United team versus <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmTuah.MY">Amirul &quot;AmTuah&quot; Afandi</a></em> and his&nbsp;Real Madrid team. In the first game, it was scoreless until&nbsp;<em>Shige </em>managed to score with <em>Man U</em> striker<em>,</em>&nbsp;<em>Zlatan Ibrahimović</em> in the closing stages of the second half, providing him with a 1-0 lead, <em>AmTuah</em> would attempt to retaliate but sadly he was short of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second round, <em>AmTuah</em> would be the one striking the first blow with <em>RMFC</em>&nbsp;striker, <em>Karim Benzema,</em> after a few back and forths in the first half. But it would not be more than 10 minutes of in-game time before <em>Shige</em> would sink a long range shot with <em>Man U</em>&nbsp;midfielder, <em>Henrikh Mkhitaryan</em>. Tieing the game 1-1 before the first half was over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not long after the beginning of the second half that <em>Shige</em> would find another goal with <em>Man U</em> midfielder, <em>Ander Herrera</em>. <em>AmTuah</em> would attempt a few attacks on <em>Shige</em>&rsquo;s goal but he managed to withstand the pressure and defend against <em>AmTuah</em>&rsquo;s attempts.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xTkcECg9m5zTgWBY9G" width="480"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><em>Shige</em>&#39;s decisive header.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the final moments of the second half, a header with <em>Man U</em>&nbsp;forward, <em>Anthony Martial</em>, would seal the win for <em>Shige</em>.

Nicholas Thien	DF_Interview_Header.jpg	500	1300	0.5x0.5		digital-fortress-soft-launch-invitational-post-match-interview	<p>A month since seeing their last LAN action, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FDGCSGO/"><em>Fire Dragoon Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em></a> team was invited to the soft launch of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Digital-Fortress-E-Sports-Arena-290469181398217/"><em>Digital Fortress E-sports Arena</em></a>&#39;s<em>&nbsp;</em>new establishment. We took some time away from&nbsp;<em>Taschvind &quot;Taz&quot; Sielan Jayasielan</em> and <em>Lee &quot;YooNgHwe&#39;1&quot; Yoong Hwei</em> during their training sessions to get their insights to the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Welcome Taz and YooNgHwe&#39;1, congratulations on winning the invitational. How did the soft launch go?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taz:</strong> <em>The soft launch was good. We really liked how they designed the place, it looks cramped but when we sat down and played, it was really spacious and had a lot of room for our equipment.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>YooNgHwe&#39;1:&nbsp;</strong><em>There was a bit of stuttering due to the LAN setting, but that&#39;s something that professional gamers notice off the bat. It was something that many would miss, so it was good that we were the first to touch the games so that they know that it&#39;s something that would affect their customers&#39; enjoyment in the future.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/07/dfsl_003.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Before coming into this invitational you guys got the 2nd runner-up position at the B5 Battle Arena, were there things that you guys worked on after your previous LAN event?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T:</strong> <em>We started working on getting to know the maps better. Every team has certain maps that they favor, so we tried our best to cover our bases by training on as many of the eligible maps as possible. This is so that we wouldn&rsquo;t be caught off-guard like we were last time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Y:</strong> <em>We also worked on strengthening our mental game. Trying to be more consistent and making fewer mistakes. Also trying our best to not let our mistakes get to us and get our heads back into the game quicker. Our coach, Aiman, helped us a lot in this regard. He kept drilling into us the right mindset that we should have.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We just wanted to clarify some stuff to our supporters regarding the roles that you (Taz) and click- play in the team. Could you give us a quick rundown on your roles?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T:</strong>&nbsp;c<em>lick- acts as our in-game leader, he is the one who decides the plays that we&rsquo;re going to make. I&rsquo;m still the captain, but my responsibilities are mostly offscreen. I keep the team under control and make sure our group dynamic is solid and composed.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/07/dfsl_002.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>YooNgHwe&#39;1, you had a few clutch plays from during the invitational, what was going through your mind during that time?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Y:</strong> <em>I actually didn&rsquo;t notice it too much while I was playing. You kinda get into a zone, I was so focused on the game that it was only after the round is over that I started feeling some of the nerves as I realized what just happened.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You lost against <a href="https://www.facebook.com/OrangeEsports/">Orange Esports</a> previously in the B5 Battle Arena, in the grand finals, you guys were matched against them. How did&nbsp;the grand finals against them go?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T:</strong> <em>To be honest, we might have slacked a little in game 1. We felt a little over confident after our win against </em><em>NaCL</em><em>. So the loss was the slap to the face we needed to get ourselves back on track.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Y:</strong>&nbsp;<em>In the second round, I think we were more familiar with the map compared to Orange. And click- managed to make really good calls that caught them off guard and we managed to climb back. We just managed to play better on the day.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/07/dfsl_001.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thank you guys for your time, we hope to see you guys at your next event soon.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Both: </strong><em>Thank you.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></p>	t	0.00160591683435381627	P	2017-08-09 17:40:56.206377+08	2017-08-09 19:06:05.76454+08	2017-08-09 17:00:00+08		123173868317227	8	9

As an esports company, we&#39;re constantly looking for new ways to interact with our fans and many have expressed that they would like to support the teams in some way but we didn&#39;t have a way for them to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="480" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/07/07/ecommercelaunchproducts.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the idea that we came up with is to have our own merchandise for sale. It&#39;s been in the works for a while now with a lot of sleepless nights getting all the details right. We believe what we&#39;re doing is not for a cheap cash grab but to create something that us as an organization and as consumers ourselves would be proud and happy to wear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/07/07/ecommercelaunchstore.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will start rolling out our products with a few items. Starting with a few choice of t-shirts, jerseys and caps. They are all designed to be fashionable and can be worn by any gender. They come in sizes starting from XS all the way to XXL. To commemorate the opening of our store, all our products will have 10% discount for the launch period of the store.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/07/07/ecommercelaunchsale.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can you get your hands on them you might ask? We have two methods, one is through our office and the other is through the online store <a href="http://shop.firedragoon.com">here</a>. Hope you guys will be as happy with our products as we are.</p>	t	0.00354050425447606596	P	2017-07-07 16:14:25.538088+08	2017-07-07 20:28:19.327645+08	2017-07-07 16:30:00+08		456775614696040	4	1
    54	The Stage of Champions	A little break to recharge, so that we can tackle all comers in the future!	Nicholas Thien	Pantheon_Header.jpg	500	1300	0.5x0.04	The whole team having a chill night at the Pantheon.	stage-champions	<p>Last Saturday, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firedragoonesports/">Fire Dragoon</a> management team and players took a break from looking at our glaring screens for a while to do a little team-building exercise. We had our event at <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThePantheonMY/">The Pantheon</a></em> which is located at One City in USJ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/10/02/pt_001.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were gracious enough to invite us to check out their Nvidia Platinum certified gaming arena which&nbsp;we took this&nbsp;opportunity to get everyone out of the office and the gaming houses and spend the night as one big family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/10/02/pt_005.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The night started when everyone was gathered together in the arena and a quick talk was given by our general manager, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/vyprex/">Jeffery &ldquo;Vyprex&rdquo; Chan</a>. It was a quick refresher on how the company has been performing and what the company&rsquo;s plans are for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/10/02/pt_002.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a good reminder of the values and vision of the company which is to help build the esports industry here in Malaysia. And as the family continues to grow, it&rsquo;s always important to get everyone on the same page and remember why the company was started in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/10/02/pt_003.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rest of the night was more chill as the players and staff got to know each other better through dinner and ice-breakers. We found out who were really good actors as they played Mafia and those who had iron stomachs for full-body Virtual Reality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/10/02/pt_004.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All-in-all it was a good time to just kick back, relax and refocus ourselves for the remainder of this year and the next. It&rsquo;s an exciting time for us as the team continues to grow and have the opportunity&nbsp;to do more for the industry outside of just competing. So we hope that you&rsquo;ll continue to keep a close eye on us as we blaze a trail for the future of esports in Malaysia.</p>	t	0.00324567528438664092	P	2017-10-02 19:48:43.305312+08	2017-10-02 19:59:25.961638+08	2017-10-02 19:30:00+08		120369955344406	11	9
    90	FDG Overwatch Release Statement	It was a fun and valuable journey for us all. Here's to hoping a better future for esports in Malaysia!	Hafiz A. Fuad	OW_Disband.jpg	1365	2048	0.52x0.37		fdg-overwatch-release-statement	<p>The inception of the Fire Dragoon Overwatch team kickstarted in March, last year during the launch of our new office. Since the beginning, they have been impressive in the local Overwatch scene and has not cease to amaze us with their spirit of teamwork and competitiveness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being one of the top teams in Southeast Asia, they have brought pride and glory to the organization by becoming champions in local tournaments such as the MSI MGA Overwatch Tournament and Jom Main! Overwatch Tournament, as well as clinching playoffs in all seasons of the ESL Overwatch SEA Open. The players are likeable, hardworking, cooperative and are willing to put the extra mile to extend their reach in many scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alas it was just not meant to be. After numerous meetings &amp; discussions among the management of Fire Dragoon, we have decided to shut down the Overwatch division, and all players would be released from FDG.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the decision is made off the current situation of the Overwatch scene in Malaysia. We felt that the local, and Southeast Asia scene is not ready for our involvement. In fact, at some point, our engagement might have been an impediment to the growth, or the creation of other competitive teams. Another factor we have considered is the booming of the mobile gaming scene which has seen increased traction and popularity. We believe that games like Mobile Legends and Arena of Valor is poised to grow as a powerhouse esports title in the region, and by freeing up the funds that was previously invested on the Overwatch division, Fire Dragoon would be able to kickstart a Mobile Gaming division within the organization, and subsequently help grow mobile esports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We wish all our players the best of luck for the future and hope that we will be able to work together again. Rest assured this is not a permanent decision, and it will not be the last time Fire Dragoon will be involved in Overwatch esports - we will be keeping watch on the scene and keep track of its growth so that someday we may find the opportunity to return.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would also like to thank all our fans for your continuous support all these times, as we would not have been able to get this far without you.</p>	t	0.0836045862105701809	P	2018-01-25 16:45:20.958404+08	2018-01-25 18:45:02.81309+08	2018-01-25 18:45:00+08		487199691674584	7	18
    27	Weekly Wrap-Up - 11/7/2017	Keeping you up to date with what happened in FDG over the past week.	Nicholas Thien	FDG-OW-Crop.jpg	706	1950	0.5x0.5	Weekly Wrap-Up	weekly-wrap-1172017	<p><u><strong>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were high hopes amongst the <em>Fire Dragoon Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> team members going into the <em>B5 Main Event Finals</em> after last week&#39;s qualification. Things started out well with their first game against Indonesian team,&nbsp;<em>Darayu</em><em> Delta Squad</em>, going 16-14, 19-16 in their two games. Continuing with their momentum of wins, the team steamrolled a young Malaysian team, <em>1Percent</em>, going 16-6, 16-10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Heading into the semifinals, the team was pitted against <em>Orange Esports</em>. Orange Esports showed who had more experience in the live tournament scene by sending the FDG team to the loser&#39;s bracket 14-16, 14-16.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the finals of the loser&#39;s bracket, FDG went against Singaporean team, <em>Candy Camel</em>, who fought back up through the loser&#39;s bracket after being sent there in the first round. They managed to beat the Fire Dragoon team, 7-16, and go into finals against Orange Esports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sadly, the team was unable to capitalize on their momentum going into last week&#39;s B5 Main Event Finals and showing the team&#39;s inexperience in a LAN setting. In the end, they managed to score the 2nd runner-up spot behind 1st runner-up Candy Camel and champion, Orange Esports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Overwatch</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FDG <em>Overwatch</em> team participated in <em>Asia Pacific University</em>&rsquo;s <em>#Play4Charity Overwatch Tournament</em>&nbsp;and managed to emerge the champions. FDG team managed to beat Malaysian Battlefield Team in game&nbsp;one but sadly they refused to play their second game against the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Sunday night, the team played their first round of matches in the <em>ESL Open Division Season 1 - Regular Season</em>&nbsp;and managed to defeat <em>No Use Talking</em> 4-2. They are currently tied for 1st in the Swiss Cup Rankings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Dota 2</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FDG <em>Dota 2</em> team managed to qualify for the <em>National Cyber Games 2017 LAN Finals</em>.&nbsp;They went against <em>LowPriority_DC</em> and won two games in their match against them. The other team in the team&#39;s group,&nbsp;<em>Generation of Miracles</em>, did not play and thus the team advanced forward to the finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>FIFA17</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the land of FIFA 17, our two FIFA players took part in the <em>GameBattle: Ultimate FIFA 17 tournament</em>. <em>Boon Shin &quot;Shige&quot;</em> was unfortunately knocked out in the best of 32 by <em>Falcon_Mujahid</em>. <em>Amirul &#39;Amtuah&#39;</em>&nbsp;<em> Afandi</em> went further and managed to get up to the quarterfinals before being knocked out by <em>Immortal_Ucop</em>.</p>	t	0.000530540198733085245	P	2017-07-11 19:55:59.729715+08	2017-07-16 05:02:53.72319+08	2017-07-11 19:55:00+08		467200380314632	10	1

Here&#39;s some insights from our captain, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/343Dota/">Adam &ldquo;adam&rdquo; Shah</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the situation of the team now?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Adam:</strong> <em>I think to start off, there was a lot of excitement with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tatsh.laijayson">ah Jit</a> and I completing the Fire Dragoon line-up along with yaNG, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrayaNtPang/">BrayaNt</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlaCrityyyyyy/">AlaCrity-</a>. But we have to admit that we have not been performing up to expectation. Two major issues that we face are communication and team synergy.<br />\r\nThings went south after we started losing games against other teams such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/highground.dota/">Team High Ground</a> and Dota Hero. To prevent things from getting worse, we decided to fully come clean and openly discuss our issues. Eventually, we decided that it was best for the team that alacrity and Brayant take a step back, while we brought in Deth-sama and <a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Syeonix">Syeonix</a> as stand-ins.<br />\r\nJust to be clear, this does not mean that AlaCrity- and BrayaNt are not good players. We all agreed that this new setup would make the team stronger and they would still contribute in team discussions. Our losses forced us to humble ourselves and look towards thinking of what&#39;s best for the team.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How does the team feel going into the qualifiers this weekend?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>We&#39;re feeling confident. This new setup has definitely made us stronger and we have managed to work out many of our issues to make sure we don&#39;t get caught off-guard. Plus, Deth-sama and Syeonix contribute a lot when it comes to making call, which really helps in terms of our team&rsquo;s synergy.<br />\r\nIn the past, we may have also underestimated our opponents. We won&#39;t let that happen this time. We want to prove that we deserve a spot at The Internationals!</em></p>	t	0.0200293010924724769	P	2017-10-12 19:02:14.128297+08	2017-10-12 19:03:18.940337+08	2017-10-12 19:00:00+08		146153125997976	5	9
    44	The Strength of Dragoons	Fire Dragoon's strength is not just that our players are good, but it's that we take strides to improve ourselves.	Nicholas Thien	Triple-Threat.jpg	500	1300	0.5x0.5		strength-dragoons	<p>There are times when we see our favorite athletes and players, it seems that they are already at the top of their game. Unstoppable. Perfect. Unbeatable against all odds. That they could win games with nothing but talent and good looks. But this view of players doesn&rsquo;t give enough respect to the actual hard work that they put in behind the scenes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We like to think that &quot;luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.&quot; Over the past few months, the teams have been working their butts off to prepare themselves for upcoming competitions. They worked on everything from macro play, team composition, mechanics and even their mental strength. The players worked on all of these aspects to give them that extra winning edge.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/18/overwatch_c2age.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>The Overwatch team after C2AGE X-treme 2017.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>A Month Ago...</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the competitive season started, our <em>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> team mostly played online and consistently won a most of their games. The team got a wake-up call during <em>B5 Battle Arena</em> when the same performance didn&rsquo;t carry forward into a LAN setting. We saw our CS:GO team landing in 3rd place, behind Singapore&#39;s <em>Candy Camel</em> and Malaysia&#39;s own <em>Orange Esports</em>, who would later on go on to win the tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our <em>FIFA 17</em> players <em>Amirul &quot;AmTuah&quot; Afandi</em> and <em>Boon Shin &quot;Shige&quot;</em> also faced struggles of their own. As well known players in the community, there was a pressure to perform. At times, choking at really clutch moments and making small mistakes cost them the match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even our <em>Overwatch </em>team, who managed to top almost all of their tournaments were not able to perform against overseas teams. This was most evident during July&#39;s <em>Jom Main!</em>&rsquo;s Overwatch tournament as the previously local-only Invitational was opened to our neighboring countries. The Overwatch team&rsquo;s winning streak came to a close when we were defeated by a Singaporean team.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/26/kitamen_fifa_interview.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>AmTuah and Shige at Kitamen FIFA 17 Tournament.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Rising to the Challenge</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these events served as a reminder to our teams and players that we needed to always be improving to face stronger opponents. So the players hunkered down and focused on improving their games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At times these training sessions were brutal, even heart-breaking, but it&#39;s only through an honest and thorough introspection would they be able to figure out what went right and what went wrong. They had to be honest with each other to find the right fit, and some minor role swaps were needed to solidify the rosters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teams also spent more time analyzing their opponents as well, finding their weaknesses and crafting strategies out of it. These strategies would incorporate the team&rsquo;s skillsets and what are the individual player&rsquo;s strengths and even include details such as what maps that their opponents favor and are good at. Thus, creating a stronger team synergy that brings out the best of each player.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our FIFA 17 players faced the challenge of needing to train up 3 different squads to fit the format set by Gamesbond in the Red Bull Coliseum. As the players were accustomed to only needing to rely on one team, this new format required them to familiarize with two other squads in order to have the best chance of qualifying for the main event.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/30/025.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>The <g class="gr_ gr_66 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Style replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="66" id="66">CS:GO</g> team outside of Digital Fortress during the IeSF 9th World Championship Qualifier.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>The Payoff</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the month of August comes to an end, we get to see the fruits of our players&#39; hard labor. The CS:GO team, won two back to back tournaments. The Invitational at <em>Digital Fortress&#39; Soft Launch</em> and again at the <em>IeSF 9th World Championship Malaysian Qualifiers</em>, giving the team a chance to represent Malaysia in Busan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>FIFA 17</em> Duo continuing to wow their followers with top ranked performances, tournament after tournament, week in and week out. Most recently, both players managing to qualify for the top 32 round in the <em>Red Bull </em><em>Colisuem</em> out of nearly 300 participants. We hope they will be able to do <em>Fire Dragoon</em> proud with a first and second placing at the event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Overwatch team managed to go toe to toe with some of the giants of the SEA Overwatch scene in the <em>ESL Overwatch Open Division Season 1</em> tournament. After a dominant showing in the initial stages, they were however stopped short at the semi-finals and attained 4th place. This is still a notable achievement as it shows that Malaysia is a strong contender in the International scene.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/07/dfsl_001.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>What next?</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is just the beginning for our Overwatch, CS:GO and FIFA 17 players. With a goal of reaching the world stage, the players will continue to compete and learn more about themselves and get better each time. Regardless of the result, the players are poised to keep improving as both individuals and teams. We hope our fans continue to support us as we keep fighting to make a stronger Fire Nation.</p>	t	0.00257251318489766815	P	2017-08-30 19:30:06.059693+08	2017-08-30 19:33:19.694996+08	2017-08-30 19:30:00+08		296583797490010	12	9
    69	World's Semi Finals Recap	The Stage is Set: China Falls in the Worlds Semifinals	Luqman "Crowe" Abdullah	The_Stage_is_Set.png	500	1300	0.5x0.5		worlds-semi-finals-recap	<p>The Chinese teams, Royal Never Give-up (RNG) and Team World Elite (WE) saw their Worlds runs come to an end at the hand of SK Telecom 1 (SKT) (3-2) and Samsung Galaxy (SSG) (3-1), respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For RNG, this marks the 4th time that the team has faced off against SKT and the 4th time they have fallen to the 3-time World Champions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The series looked very different after Game 3 where RNG snatched a convincing win over their Korean counterparts and looked to be ready to put SKT away at 2-1. However, Coach Kkoma subbed in Peanut for Blank who went on to go 2-0 in the series, utilizing his superior smite timing and cheeky, early ganks to catch RNG off guard. His precise mechanics pulled the team to a decisive victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for WE, their semifinals showing was much less exciting, dropping 3 games straight to SSG after winning Game 1 of the series. Even after giving the Chinese team their famed Galio/Jarvan composition, SSG still managed to easily outmaneuver the composition on their way to winning the series on a 3-game streak.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stage is set for a collision course of the two Korean finalists to fight for the Summoner&rsquo;s Cup in the finals stage at the Beijing National Stadium, also known as the Bird&rsquo;s Nest. Despite meeting under the same circumstances a year ago, the teams approach the Finals looking very different this time around.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their previous clash during the 2016 World Championship, Samsung, who qualified after having drawn what was widely viewed as a very easy bracket to the finals (against Europe&rsquo;s 2nd Seed, H2k-Gaming and North America&rsquo;s 2nd Seed, Cloud9), were viewed as the underdogs. On the other hand, SKT was the picture of consistency and strength. However Samsung pushed SKT to 5 games only to fall short in the final game, giving way to SKT&rsquo;s 3rd World Championship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Samsung appears to be on the rise after having dispatched tournament favourites Longzhu Gaming in the Quarterfinals. They have been exhibiting an extremely dominant form in all of their Knockout Stage matches, whereas SKT are limping into the Finals after being pushed to 5 games in both their Quarterfinals and Semifinals matches. Even Misfits, a team most had written off from Knockout Stage contention, managed to give the prestigious SKT a run for their money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Samsung, led by the experience of Ambition are looking more and more as the team to beat this year. However, it is very hard to bet against a team as dominant and fabled as SKT with players like Faker and Bang, who have consistently delivered great performances even in dire situations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll just to wait and see if history will repeat itself, or if Samsung can establish themselves as legends by toppling the dynasty of SKT.</p>	t	0.000583586146382027464	P	2017-11-01 16:08:28.145472+08	2017-11-01 16:08:47.461882+08	2017-11-01 16:00:00+08		367619633681210	1	9

Fuad	New_Roster_CSGO_Jan_2018.jpg	800	800	0.53x0.32		The-Double-A-Battery-Aiman-Acap-for-FDG	<p>Aiman &quot;aimaNNN&quot; Azham and Ashraf &quot;acAp&quot; Firdaus are no strangers to the local CSGO competitive scene. They have been contributing to the Malaysian esports scene for quite awhile even bringing our Malaysian pride to a couple of international tournaments. They have been a dominant force in teams like MVP Karnal and JYP Gaming and performed well in tournaments such as Asean Games for Esports 2016, eXTREMELAND ZOWIE Asia CSGO and more. On the international stage, they have shown their prowess in tourneys like WESG 2016 Asia Pacific and BeyondGodlike SEA CSGO League.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So we are going to delve a bit deeper and discover more about these players.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="Image taken from HLTV.org" src="https://static.hltv.org/images/galleries/9866-medium/1484208951.034.jpeg" />\r\n<figcaption>aimannN with JYP Gaming in WESG Finals</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>aimannN</strong> started playing Counter Strike when his brother persuaded him to play Counter Strike when he was in primary school. Of course it was just a game back then to him and he was just a little child trying to find some casual fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A couple of years later he joined his first amateur tournaments and started having plans to play competitively and join tournaments. He would spend his time and resources to practice in a cyber cafe as back then he did not have his own personal computer. That would all change in 2013 when he had enough money from his winnings to buy his own computer to play Counter Strike at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His first official team was Team TYT (aka Trust Your Teammate). This was a team he built with his friends and the name was chosen to not have a sense of total seriousness, but it would not last long. He transferred to a couple of other teams like Throw Gaming, MVP Gaming before it was known as MVP Karnal and finally JYP Gaming before he went to Fire Dragoon. When he joined FDG, he was still doing his studies and was unable to play competitively so he opted to do his part as a coach. Now he&rsquo;s playing full time as a player for FDG CSGO as team captain.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="Image taken from csgo2asia.com" height="1728" src="https://csgo2asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/acap_aerowolf-e1504154246985.jpeg" width="2592" />\r\n<figcaption>acAp playing for JYP Gaming</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>acAp</strong>&rsquo;s story is not that different with aimannN with the fact that their brothers persuaded them to play together during their primary school years. acAp&rsquo;s brother taught him to properly play Counter Strike only a couple of years after he started. He stopped in due time of playing CS to play DotA and eventually stopped playing altogether to focus on football.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia) he went to a shop in SS15, Subang Jaya&nbsp;to buy CS1.6, however the shop only sells CSGO. That was how his journey in CSGO started, because of a shop not having enough stocks of CS1.6. A bit funny isn&#39;t it? :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the years of his CSGO experience he joined many teams with a few of them being the same teams as aimannN. After aimannN left, acAp accepted an offer to play for an Indonesian team called Aerowolf. There he grabbed lots of wins for the team even to a point of beating the best Indonesian team in a tournament. After awhile he expressed his intentions of returning to Malaysia as his mother was sick with athritis and he wants to make use of his international experience in the local scene. After finding out that acAp has returned, aimannN immediately contacted him and offered a place in Fire Dragoon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="Acapman" height="349" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/hafiz/2018/01/03/acapman.PNG" width="487" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These two players first met in an international tournament qualifier which ended with aimannN&rsquo;s team defeating acAp&rsquo;s. They began playing together after aimannN&rsquo;s friend suggested acAp as the last addition to the team. They have been playing together through a lot of teams namely Throw Gaming, MVP Karnal, JYP Gaming and now, Fire Dragoon Esports. aimannN provides a lot of support for acAp in the form of game mechanics and how to carry himself professionally during trainings and tournaments since acAp&rsquo;s the relaxed and casual kind of guy so sometimes he gets a bit too nonchalant. On the other hand acAp with his laid-back demeanor supports aimannN by helping the organized, stern captain let loose and calm down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope with the many feats they have attained from previous teams and the synergy they have build up from years of experience, they will be able to help Fire Dragoon become one of the most dominant teams in South East Asia and in time, the world.</p>	t	0.00681422411243466034	P	2018-01-03 11:46:25.742959+08	2018-01-03 18:00:01.635568+08	2018-01-03 18:00:00+08		216605118884279	8	18

The team, who reached their second world finals in two years relied heavily on mid laner Crown&rsquo;s mechanics and Ambition&rsquo;s experience to reach the finals, were nearly completely transformed this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They were much more well rounded than last season and seemed to be able to lean on any of their members to take over the game. And it seemed to be the difference as they simply outclassed SKT in nearly all phases of the finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Throughout my career, this Worlds was the first tournament that I truly enjoyed and had fun in&rdquo; said Crown in an interview following the match.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The path to the finals was not easy for Samsung who dispatched both Longzhu, the tournament favorite and SKT. the defending world champions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Starting from the 2nd week, I started playing with the mindset of &ldquo;enjoying my matches&rdquo; because the way I played before was unsuccessful. I started seeing and &ldquo;feeling the crowd and tried to enjoy my time here&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get ready for a new set of new world championship skins. I, for one, am looking forward to Samsung Galaxy Malzahar.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/11/08/lol_worlds_faker.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>Faker in tears after the 3-0 loss.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SKT&rsquo;s Collapse</strong><br />\r\nThe argument for an SKT comeback was more than convincing. The defending World Champions had won every Worlds they had attended, were undefeated in elimination matches at Worlds and boasted the world&rsquo;s greatest player, Faker. And the tide seemed to be turning in their favor when Faker&rsquo;s Karma roamed about the map making plays wherever he went in the mid game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However he was later caught out without flash and could only watch as Samsung moved in to destroy his team&rsquo;s Nexus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The esports icon was overcame with emotion and sat with his head in his hands when Samsung came to their booth to shake hands and even thereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certainly there are lots of reasons that SKT were beaten so decisively. Their draft seemed unfocused and desperate. Their play was too reactive and impatient and in the knockout stages leading to the final, they had been pushed to the fifth game by teams that they were widely considered superior to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their issues did not start at Worlds, many had documented a significant drop off in the performance of members on the team which prompted substitutions to take place throughout the season. However, SKT has struggled in the past and somehow always managed to pull through in the moments where it mattered most on the world stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the analyst desk was quick to predict that Samsung would beat the defending champs, but none of them predicted a swift 3-0 to crown the new kings of the League of Legends world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were moments in some of the games where you felt that SKT was beginning to impose their will, but in those moments they consistently fell short to the will of Samsung.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While SKT may not be World Champs of 2017, they are still the runner-up which gives them the right to call themselves the 2nd best team in the World.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However if we know anything about SKT, we know that this loss will only fuel them for the year to come and personally, I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/11/08/lol_worlds_champions.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>Samsung Galaxy lifting the Summoner&#39;s Cup.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>End of An Era?</strong><br />\r\nThis Worlds may have left us with more questions than answers, as Samsung Galaxy managed to take Worlds without having won their domestic league. It also raises questions about Longzhu and what steps they will take to reclaim their domestic dominance or improve their odds on the international stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is this the end of the SKT era and the beginning of a Samsung Galaxy one? Will they finally win a domestic split? Will SKT stay together?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter what the next season holds, it promises to be an interesting one, and now all we have to do, is wait.</p>	t	0.0010581076833887002	P	2017-11-08 14:57:53.138621+08	2017-11-08 16:18:55.614702+08	2017-11-08 15:00:00+08		623612961362583	1	9
    61	Week 2: Heroes & Heartbreak	Worlds continues to have its share of upsets and delights.	Luqman "Crowe" Abdullah	Worlds_W2_Recap.png	500	1300	0.5x0.5		week-2-heroes-heartbreak	<p>Week 2 at Worlds always promises to be an exciting one. This weekend we saw heroes become legends and champions fall short of our expectations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TSM Flops in Groups, Again:</strong><br />\r\nSo what else is new? Team Solomid (TSM) went 2-1 in Week 1 and dropped 2 games in Group Stages to set up a tiebreaker against Misfits (MSF). They let that slip away from them, which cost them their birth into the bracket stage. This is the third straight year that the team has failed to make it out of groups, and despite many promises of growth throughout the season, the North American favorites are forced to watch yet another Worlds&rsquo; Bracket Stage from the sidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chinese Teams Rise&hellip; Except EDG:</strong><br />\r\nTeam Royal Never Give-up (RNG) &amp; Team WE (WE) both managed to qualify for the Bracket Stage with a record of 10-2 combined while EDward Gaming (EDG)&#39;s curse came full swing, landing them at the bottom of Group A. EDG came into the tournament after having won the LoL Pro League (LPL) only to have yet another disappointing finish at the World Championships. This is the first time that the squad has failed to qualify for the Bracket Stage since its inception in 2014.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fnatic and Misfits Solidify Themselves as Legends:</strong><br />\r\nMSF had an impressive day that ended with them toppling the North American champions, TSM. On the other hand, Fnatic (FNC), who started their Worlds campaign going 0-3, performed an utter miracle by getting a tiebreaker victory and earning them a place in the Bracket Stage. This feat was not just a miracle, but also redemption for the team&rsquo;s captain Rekkles, who missed Worlds last year after the departure of Reignover and Huni.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gigabyte Marines Stole Our Hearts, But Not A Bracket Stage Spot:</strong><br />\r\nThe Gigabyte Marines (GAM) have been one of the most off the wall, unpredictable, fun to watch teams at Worlds this year, but fell just short of a Bracket Stage birth when they lost the tiebreaker match to previously mentioned FNC. The team famed for playing unconventional compositions paired with unique strategies shocked the world over-and-over again but were inevitably unable to finish off FNC after pulling ahead in the early game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Koreans Continue to Roll:</strong><br />\r\nOf all the narratives at Worlds, the real question still remains: &quot;Can anyone stop the Koreans?&quot; All three Korean representatives qualified out of their Groups, and with the bracket shaking out the way it has, it appears that top rated SKT and Longzhu Gaming are on a collision course to meet in the finals&hellip; unless, of course, someone beats them. The best candidates? Perhaps RNG, who is playing with a home-field advantage and a favorable meta for their star player &quot;Uzi&quot;. However, only time will tell who will take home the Summoner&#39;s Cup this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luqman &quot;Crowe&quot; Abdullah is Fire Dragoon&#39;s newly appointed coach for the League of Legends team.</p>	t	0.000748556121661812617	P	2017-10-18 11:41:06.127613+08	2017-10-18 15:00:01.153243+08	2017-10-18 15:00:00+08		2062564747095605	1	9

    36	Digital Fortress Soft Launch Invitational Recap	The team was invited to play at the Digital Fortress Soft Launch Invitational where the team managed to settle old scores.	Nicholas Thien	DFSL_header1.jpg	500	1300	0.5x0.5		digital-fortress-soft-launch-invitational-recap	<p>Over the weekend, the <em>Fire Dragoon Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</em> team was invited to play at the <em>Digital Fortress E-sports Arena</em> soft launch alongside some of the big names of the Malaysian CS: GO scene, <em>Orange Esports</em>, <em>Virtual Genesis Esports</em>, and a few of <em>Digital Fortress</em>&#39; in-house teams rounding out the 8 teams that are playing in the invitational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Digital Fortress</em> is a new cyber cafe that is designed for tournaments and streaming. The arrangement of the desktops encourages teamplay with each table having 5-6 computers in a row. With the invitational, it was a good chance for the organizers at <em>Digital Fortress</em> to test out their network setup and LAN play. But little did they know, that it was also going to be a battleground of pride.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/07/dfsl_002.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>The team playing with fresh new equipment.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The invitational started with a Swiss group stage&nbsp;on Saturday, to qualify for the playoffs the teams had to win 3 games of best out of 1 matches. The team managed to start off the invitational with a win against <em>NaCL</em>. Going 16-10 on <em>Cache</em>. However, the joy would be short-lived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In their next match against <em>1Percent</em> later in the afternoon, the team was going neck-to-neck for most of the match with a few clutch plays from FDG player <em>YooNgHwe&#39;1</em>. The game went into overtime but <em>1Percent</em> managed to outplay the team in the last few crucial rounds to clinch the win, 17-19, on <em>Mirage</em>. With one win and one lost on the team&#39;s scoreboard, it was time to buckle down for the remaining two games.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team managed to pull themselves together after their loss and showed their dominance against <em>Virtual Genesis Esports</em> and the <em>Digital Fortress</em> in house team by going&nbsp;16-4 for both matches. This qualifyied the team for the playoffs and they were able to close the day on a high note with exceptional gameplay and teamwork.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/07/dfsl_003.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>Back for more action on Sunday.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>Returning on Sunday, the team would meet against <em>NaCL</em> for the second time that weekend but <em>NaCL</em> was still unable to come up with a solution against the FDG team leaving the team with a 2-0 win and the chance to face off against <em>Orange Esports</em> who earlier in the day defeated <em>1Percent</em> in the grand finals of the invitational.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would not be the first time that the two powerhouses of Malaysian esports would meet, the previous major tournament, <em>B5 Battle Arena</em>, <em>Orange Esports</em> were the victors during their match in the winner bracket finals and it was time for FDG team to show them what they&#39;ve learnt over the past month since these two titans went head-to-head against each other. Would it be a repeat of B5 Battle Arena or would FDG emerge the victors?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first game seemed to be their&nbsp;worst fears realized as the team lost a close match against the <em>Orange Esports</em> team, going 14-16. There was a heavy mood as they went into the second game, in hushed tones the crowd felt that we would be seeing a repeat experience of <em>B5 Battle Arena</em> where the more experienced <em>Orange Esports</em> team kept their composure against the pressure from the FDG team and were the victors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there seemed to be signs of a breakthrough for the FDG team in the second round. Unable to find a solution to stop the FDG team, the <em>Orange Esports</em> broke down and gave way to a landslide win of 16-3 to FDG. Both teams tied 1-1 heading into the final game of the grand finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The initial stages of the final game saw <em>Orange Esports</em> and FDG trading wins back and forth up until 7-5 points with FDG staying ahead leading by two points, at the time it seemed to be anyone&#39;s game.&nbsp;It was then that the FDG team managed to find their groove and went on a winning streak gaining 8 points with&nbsp;<em>Orange Esports</em>&nbsp;only managing to score their last two points in the final stages of the game before FDG scored their last point which ended the game,&nbsp;this ended the game with a score of 16-7.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/07/dfsl_001.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>The team immediately after their win in the final game against Orange Esports.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a thrilling experience to see the two powerhouses go against each other, showing the talent of Malaysia&#39;s <em>CS:GO</em> players with their high-level play and teamwork as well as the individual plays that were crucial victories that make the game exciting. We also congratulate <em>Digital Fortress</em> on the soft launch of their new establishment and hope that any gamers who are around&nbsp;Desa Sri Hartamas to give them a try once they open fully.</p>	t	0.00409814131665569171	P	2017-08-07 19:54:58.522653+08	2017-08-07 20:01:28.34081+08	2017-08-07 19:30:00+08		257691748072228	8	9

However, Longzhu has had a much more dominant performance as they looked convincing in every victory, while SKT has had to play from behind in every game this week. While it is true that a win is a win, can we expect Longzhu to dispatch SKT should they run into them in the knockout stage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Royal Never Give-up undefeated.</strong><br />\r\n<a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Royal_Never_Give_Up">Royal Never Give-up (RNG)</a> is the only undefeated Chinese team left after week 1, with intimidating performances, most notably when they took down <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy">Samsung Galaxy</a> in convincing fashion. The two-time Worlds finalist team appears to be in rare form, but can it finally bring their star marksman <em><a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Uzi_(Jian_Zi-Hao)">Uzi</a></em> a World Championship?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is wrong with the LMS?</strong><br />\r\nThe <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/League_of_Legends_Master_Series">League of Legends Masters Series (LMS)</a> teams have only won a single game between their region&#39;s two representatives. The <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Flash_Wolves">Flash Wolves</a> have looked uncharacteristically passive, especially <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Karsa"><em>Karsa</em></a> who appears to simply be absent at the World Championship so far. <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Ahq_e-Sports_Club">ahq e-Sports Club</a> on the other hand have had bright moments, but seem unable to close games in the decisive moments of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gigabyte Marines Lane Swap Mayhem</strong><br />\r\n<a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/GIGABYTE_Marines">Gigabyte Marines (GAM)</a> came out of the gates with a bang, taking it to <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Fnatic">Fnatic</a> in their first match of groups before locking a double marksmen composition featuring <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Mordekaiser">Mordekaiser</a> which Longzhu exploited and then falling short with a <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Kayn">Kayn</a> composition against <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Immortals">Immortals</a>. It seems almost impossible to prepare for a game against GAM, but this unpredictability is not bringing them too many victories. Seeing GAM bring out creative strategies and off the wall picks is fun, but is it enough to get them out of groups?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is North America the 2nd Best Region at Worlds?</strong><br />\r\nAll 3 North American teams finished 2-1 after the first week of the Group Stage and are all in pole position to make it out of their groups. All have lost to Korean teams apart from <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Team_SoloMid">Team Solomid</a>, who managed to drop a game to <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Misfits_(European_Team)">Misfits</a> after having sound performances against those who are perceived as the stronger teams in their group. While we have another week of groups before knockout stages begin, so far, NA seems to be finally producing teams that can compete with the strongest teams the world has to offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hope for the Europeans?</strong><br />\r\nAfter a week of competition only Misfits remains in contention for the top spot in their group while their European companions (Fnatic and <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/G2_Esports">G2 Esports (G2)</a>) are in the bottom 2 of their groups. While Misfits&#39; path to a playoff berth seems straight-forward enough (beat the same teams they beat this week), G2 and Fnatic face much more dire circumstances. Fnatic must run the table and win all their games to even have a chance to make it out of their group and G2 must beat either Samsung Galaxy or RNG in order to have a shot at making it out of theirs. While it may be a long shot, there is still a glimmer of hope for the Europeans who have had multiple semifinal appearances at Worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/luqman.abdullah1">Luqman &quot;Crowe&quot; Abdullah</a> when he&#39;s not schooling you in Street Fighter V, is a former manager of Kuala Lumpur Hunters.</p>	t	0.000991482655205744388	P	2017-10-11 16:05:10.150781+08	2017-10-11 16:39:23.298915+08	2017-10-11 16:30:00+08		1764773310263828	1	9

Many people on the other side of the spectrum are skeptical with the game considering it is still new as the game is less than a year old. That very game is PlayerUnknown&rsquo;s Battlegrounds or more commonly known as PUBG (pronounced Pub-Gee by most players here). The game has managed to garner the attention and gained popularity in the gaming community, but can it develop into an esport?</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="274" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/hafiz/2018/01/18/pubg-886916.jpg" width="462" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The game involves 100 players in a map scouring for weapons and finding equipment in the early stages of a match. After a while, a circle will appear and players will need to get in it or risk your health getting reduced, eventually leading to death. The circle will get smaller and smaller until only one player (or one team) is left. The game provides vehicles like cars, bikes and buggies for transportation purposes as the maps are huge. Tournaments are held for individual, two-people per team, or 4-player team categories in a 6-8 set of games using a point-system. Each kill and placement in a match will award you with points that will be totalled up in the end to decide the winners.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="273" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/hafiz/2018/01/18/pubg-iem-oakland-dh09gf873.jpg" width="491" />\r\n<figcaption>Tournament layout at IEM Oakland</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>What exactly makes PUBG a game worth watching? The idea of 100 players fighting for their very survival makes it enticing for spectators as the game has a Hunger Games element to it. When there&rsquo;s a huge lump of cash waiting for you if you get chicken dinner (the equivalent of first place in PUBG), it gets more intense. You start thinking about every move you make and whether it&rsquo;s the right thing for you to do. Should you just camp and wait till the other players move on, or take the risk and start shooting. Players start going through things tactfully instead of screaming &ldquo;YOLO!&rdquo; and charge in. The thrill of seeing one player wipe out other players within seconds in a tournament is just exhilarating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there is the random elements of the game. The plane will go into the map from various angles and never the same in each game. Players may choose to chill in the plane for awhile and wait for other players to jump out first. Once you hit the ground, there is no telling what kind of weapon you will get. Will it be a handgun? Or an assault rifle? Or maybe a frying pan? You also have to worry about the placement of the circle. Are you in the circle? If you&rsquo;re not you have to move in before it decreases in size. The element of chance built into the game keeps you on your toes so you can&rsquo;t go into the game expecting each one to be the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the games are partially based on chance, this can be the cause to seeing different faces winning each time. The only thing that is the same in each map is the layout of them so skillful players can utilize that to their advantage. In the recent IEM Oakland, Tempo Storm will consistently be one of the first to reach an advantageous position before the rest of the teams. Because of this they secured second place in the tournament due to thinking ahead of other players and securing a favourable position on the map.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therein lies a problem. Because there is a wad of cash waiting for players who win, people start going through the game slowly and carefully. People start using safe routes, hiding in rivers, avoiding confrontation unless necessary and other low risk measures for the sake of cash (although there is nothing wrong with that). Popular streams often have players going guns blazing into a house, ramming a person using a car or going at another player with just his bare fists. The crazy on-stream actions don&rsquo;t usually happen in a tournament setting, but if it does&nbsp;expect the crowd to go wild.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another point to observe that contributes to the lack of action in tournaments is because of the point system. Each kill nets you 10 points, but getting a chicken dinner will provide you with 300 points. Unless you&rsquo;re just that good and able to confidently get 30 kills out of the other 99 players out there, obviously surviving is the way to go. The point system makes players go the safe route of camping and surviving until the end and engage enemies if necessary. This leads to the slow pace action of matches that most fans may not be accustomed to.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="281" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/hafiz/2018/01/18/pubg-in-a-nutshell.jpg" width="499" />\r\n<figcaption>This rarely happen in major tournaments.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>PUBG would be so much more fun to watch with a dedicated spectator-cam for the viewers so they may know how many players are left, an automated system that will make the camera move to the players that are close to each other just in case any action happens or a replay system that can cover actions that were missed out. Not to mention increasing the points for each kill would be good as it may promote action to happen for the teams instead of just passiveness to victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite being only a year old the game has attracted many players and esports organizations to invest the time and resources into the game. The game itself is fun to watch, but whether it can provide the same level of fun and excitement if played in a tournament has yet to be determined. However, with some changes here and there to improve viewership, the game might someday be able to be one of the most sought out esport titles.</p>	t	0.00523414046377228357	P	2018-01-18 18:25:42.42304+08	2018-01-18 19:00:00.562832+08	2018-01-18 19:00:00+08		805295043011434	11	18
    25	Pre-B5 Battle Arena Main Event Interview	Before the Main Event, we pick the brain of our CS:GO coach.

Not wanting to give up the opportunity to play in a tournament, our&nbsp;CS:GO team jumped at the chance and signed up for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To qualify for the event, the team had to secure a spot in either one of the two qualifiers. One was through online which featured teams outside of Malaysia and another was a LAN qualifier here in Kuala Lumpur. They faced their first challenge in the online qualifier when circumstances didn&#39;t go our team&#39;s way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/07/06/csgo_b5balq_bracket.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily for the team, their&nbsp;chances to qualify didn&#39;t end with the online qualifier&nbsp;and they steeled themselves for the LAN Qualifier&nbsp;held at Orange Stadium, Setapak last weekend. This time, nothing stood in the way of the team&nbsp;and they managed to clinch one of the coveted spots for the main event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As it&#39;s one of the bigger events for the CS:GO team this year, we wanted to get a little more insight and who else would know better than our CS:GO coach, Aiman &quot;AimaNNN&quot; Azhan. So, we took him out of his busy schedule and&nbsp;picked his brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/07/06/csgo_b5balq_venue.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What w</strong><strong>as the mood like for the team coming into the qualifier? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The mood of the team going to the LAN qualifier on last Saturday was really good. Everyone in the team wanted to compete and win as a team. Plus, they were excited to compete in&nbsp;a LAN tournament after quite some time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did it feel like playing in a LAN compared to playing online?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The difference of playing LAN and Online is definitely significant. Everyone tends to be more competitive during a LAN tournament, where most of them do the war-cry and cheer loudly. LAN will definitely add more pressure to the players because&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;is watching you. Sometimes a spotlight can ruin the player&#39;s performance due to too much pressure to take on.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/07/06/csgo_b5balq_group.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did the team feel when they qualified?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The team and I definitely felt relieved and excited after qualifying for the main event. We are definitely looking forward on this Saturday for the Main E</em><em>vent</em><em>. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What expectations do you have for the upcoming main event and how do you plan to train for it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Our expectation coming into this B5 Battle Arena CSGO Tournament is definitely to be Champion. We want to push and improve ourselves by aiming high which it will always keep our focus on winning as a team. I feel that currently, any team in this Tournament can beat each other. It&#39;s just a matter who performs well on the day.</em></p>	t	0.00109853066439459025	P	2017-07-06 14:40:08.167258+08	2017-07-06 15:23:17.218869+08	2017-07-06 15:00:00+08		2320533204839245	8	1
    41	Keeping Watch - August 2017 Edition	Recap of our Overwatch team's endeavours.	Nicholas Thien	KeepWatch_Aug.jpg	426	1280	0.5x0.5	The FDG Overwatch team during their last LAN event.	keeping-watch-august-2017-edition	<p>It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve last heard much about our <em>Overwatch</em> players, but it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ve been keeping quiet all this time. The team has been having a ton of great games and as a lead up to our team playing at <em>ESL&#39;s Overwatch Open Division Season - Playoffs</em> this weekend, we decided to highlight a number of events that our teams had been taking part in over the past month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First off, let&#39;s take a look at the tournament that the team played locally.&nbsp; The last time that we&#39;ve seen our Overwatch team out in the open was last month&#39;s&nbsp;<em>C2AGE X-treme 2017</em>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<em>HELP University.</em>&nbsp;The team took part in&nbsp;<em>Neueaka Overwatch Merdeka Cup 2017</em> last weekend, the event was organized by Neueaka Resources, produced by Midnight Ga<em>ming</em> and outside of <em>Fire Dragoon</em>, 3 other top teams from Malaysia were invited to take part in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="1408" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/08/21/merdekacup.jpg" width="1920" />\r\n<figcaption>The FDG team was invited to play at Neueaka Merdeka Cup last weekend with other top&nbsp;Malaysian teams.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p>The team&#39;s first opponent of the day was <em>M8.Gaming</em> and after an hour of intense gameplay the FDG team managed to come out on top, 3-0. In their next match of the day, the team went against <em>Sirius </em>who in their earlier match defeated <em>MBT - Malaysian Battlefield Team</em>. The match against Sirius went over an hour before they conceded 3-0 to the FDG team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Securing a spot in the grand final, the FDG team would have to wait and see who would emerge the victors of the loser bracket finals and it was Sirius who they defeat earlier. However, Sirius was unable to find a solution to beat the FDG team and went 4-0 with FDG becoming the champions and Sirius the runner-ups.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center"><iframe class="embed-responsive" frameborder="0" height="303" scrolling="no" src="http://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=1885092625144906" width="540"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of the local scene, the team has been playing every weekend at <em>ESL&#39;s Overwatch Open Division Season 1 - Regular Season</em>. The current season of ESL is made up of teams from all over South East Asia, 33 teams made up of teams from all over Asia. From Singapore to Thailand, going all the way up to India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team managed to place fourth and is the only Malaysian team that has made it into the playoffs. What&#39;s more impressive is that the team has been winning convincingly, conceding at most 2 points to one of their opponents with the rest being held at 0 or 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center"><iframe class="embed-responsive" frameborder="0" height="303" scrolling="no" src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v168621143&autoplay=false" width="540"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether it&#39;s the local scene or internationally against the rest of Asia, the Fire Dragoon team has managed to stand strong on all fronts. We&#39;re really proud of the performance that the FDG team has been putting out and they definitely deserve to be known as one of the first-class teams in Malaysia. We wish them luck in the upcoming ESL Overwatch Open Season - Playoffs and continue to do Malaysia proud in the Overwatch scene.</p>	t	0.00178393745497033547	P	2017-08-21 20:00:02.317915+08	2017-08-22 20:31:00.858875+08	2017-08-21 20:00:00+08		320458678365779	7	9

What changed between then and now?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>aimaNNN:</strong> <em>I feel that at the beginning we weren&#39;t stable enough as a team. The chemistry and bond is still not there, therefore our previous performance is inconsistent. Other than that, we did a slight change in the team training schedule and I able to guide them more ingame and outside game. When we have a structure in the game, thats when we able to progress slowly in our improvement.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you guys considered the best in Malaysia yet? What&#39;s the benchmark?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A:</strong> <em>In my opinion, we are not the best team in Malaysia... yet. Although we won our last 3 tournaments but they were all still very close matches. Thus, it&rsquo;s not like we have been dominating for more than a year, we are just getting started. So I can&#39;t say that we are the best team in Malaysia yet. My goal is to dominate for more than a year without losing the big tournaments then and only then can we be considered the top team in Malaysia.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/09/20/mannn_001.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>It&#39;s not all business at the CS:GO camp.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How has esports changed when you first started until now?

Esports is growing bigger and bigger, and we here in Malaysia must not fall behind. In my opinion, for a new player like d4v41 and 3nable they definitely need to learn more in terms of being a leader and team player or, in other words, gain more experience.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>There are a lot of young players who are talented, it&rsquo;s just that there are few veteran players that have the opportunity to guide them along the correct path.

As a player, you feel so happy and satisfied after all your ups and downs throughout the journey while on the other hand as a coach, you feel very proud of the team as they overcome their fears and perform as a cohesive unit.

    29	The Fire Dragoon Philosophy	What defines Fire Dragoon?	Jeffery "Vyprex" Chan	Esportssplash.jpg	500	1300	0.5x0.5		fire-dragoon-philosophy	<p>It has been approximately 4 months since I left my job in an advertising agency to pursue esports on a large scale. Not only that I left stability in a traditional corporate job, but I dove into probably one the most nerve-wracking way to work on my passion - an esports startup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, why did I voluntarily put myself in such challenging situation? What are the motivational factors that led me into where I am today?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passion has got to be one of the main reason I am still in esports but at some point of time, I find that it is more of an avenue for me to give back to the industry I was brought up with, and an industry that I hold dearly. Esports has impacted my life in many ways and I felt that it is my duty to provide and build the scene for the younger players who are putting in their time and effort to leave their mark in esports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are quite a number of organisations that I can look into working with, and all are great - but ultimately, I&rsquo;ve decided to go with Fire Dragoon due to the philosophy the organisation uphold and run on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was at a local &lsquo;Mamak&rsquo; in SS2 just a few weeks back with some of my colleague late at night for supper after a long day at work and I asked them a question - What defines Fire Dragoon?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question brought everyone in deep thought for the rest of the night.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was shocking at the same time too, because after the many sacrifices every individual put into building the organisation to where it is today, some of us did not even know why Fire Dragoon &nbsp;exist in the first place!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I could go on rambling for another 10,000 words to explain the Fire Dragoon&rsquo;s philosophy, but I will save it for future blogs. However, there are 3 core values that everyone in the organisation is being reminded of when making any decision</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Building the esports foundation</strong>, and to provide an avenue for young, driven and passionate youths to showcase their talents which is severely undervalued. We have always believed that great esport athletes are one with great talents, just needing the right platform to grow.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Grooming for the future</strong>, and to make esports a viable career path for the talented and hardworking. We look to groom and shape these rough diamonds into wonderful jewels to maintain and uphold the future of esports in Malaysia.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<p><strong>Setting a standard</strong> high enough that would help showcase what we do in esports, and to demonstrate how esports is &lsquo;not just playing games&rsquo; but instead, an industry that revolves around everything we see in a normal corporate job.</p>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The past 4 months have been exhausting, but is no doubt the most exciting months of my life. I look forward to share more in the near future as there would be more exciting stuffs coming into the Malaysian esports industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until then, do continue to support Fire Dragoon as we build the industry, one step at a time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>	t	0.00191105948583016462	P	2017-07-14 09:40:59.44923+08	2017-07-14 09:42:31.046025+08	2017-07-14 09:34:57+08		107606219895346	11	7

Nicholas Thien	LoL_ieSF_Header_002.png	500	1300	0.5x0.5		living-good-rough-life	<p>Shortly before getting on the flight to Busan to represent Malaysia in the IeSF World Championships 2017 for League of Legends, we sat down with Team Rough Life one more time before they left to get some feedback about their experience training under our roof and gauge their excitement level heading out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>After almost a week in our offices, how has your experience been like training together?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Team Rough Life:</strong> <em>A huge difference from how we trained before is obviously the time that we&rsquo;re spending together. We used to talk a lot just through online but just spending a week together really felt like a camp. It has definitely improved our in-game performance as we get to know each other better living together.<br />\r\nIn the past, we actually just set a time to meet online and played randomly against whoever we could match-up with. Now we&rsquo;re in the same room and while we&rsquo;re not as used to communicating with each other face to face yet, it&rsquo;s definitely a really rewarding experience to play with each other in the same room for a long periods of time.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Talking to your coach, Crowe, he seemed pretty pleased with your progress. How do you feel you&rsquo;ve improved?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>TRL:</strong> <em>I felt that we&rsquo;ve improved a lot. We kinda just did our own things and I guess we were lucky to have gotten so far. But having someone coaching us, giving pointers about what to do and what not to do. We hope that we can make Malaysia proud with our efforts.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And I hope that you guys do well. Crowe, any last words for the team?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Crowe:</strong> <em>I definitely feel that they&rsquo;ve made a ton of improvement over such a short period of time. I will miss their enthusiasm and excitement for the game, it&rsquo;s gotten me really excited for the upcoming season.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/11/07/iesf_lol_003.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The interview was conducted in Mandarin and was translated and edited for clarity.</em></p>	t	0.00198248102201894691	P	2017-11-07 17:30:10.172962+08	2017-11-07 18:02:30.430519+08	2017-11-07 17:30:00+08		1791430574482842	1	9
    53	FIFA 18 Early Access Impressions	Getting into early access, the FIFA duo gave their quick impressions on the new game.	Nicholas Thien	FDG_FIFA18_Header.jpg	500	1300	0.5x0.5	EA Canada/EA Sports	fifa-18-early-access-impressions	<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/09/27/fifa18_replays.png" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting their hands on an early access copy of <a href="https://www.easports.com/fifa"><em>FIFA 18</em></a>,&nbsp;just a few days ahead of the official launch in Asia and the boys have&nbsp;been playing the game non-stop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We tried our best to pry&nbsp;the players away from the game for as long as possible for them to give their first impressions on how the game feels different from last year&#39;s version.</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>1. Removal of auto-defense</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/09/27/fifa18_defense.png" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With more responsive controls, the developers have decided to remove &quot;auto-defending&quot; from <em>FIFA 18</em>. Initial impression is that this might mean higher scoring games, but the players are adamant that with time, these scores will go down as players adapt and start focusing on defense .</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The goalkeepers however... are broken! Right now, they aren&#39;t controllable by the player and they concede goals that professional players would not. Therefore, this problem together with adapting to the removal of auto-defense creates matches that have scores that are close to the double digits which should not happen in football. However sitting besides <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmTuah.MY/">AmTuah</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fdg.shige/">Shige</a>, we&#39;ve seen at least 8 out of 10 games that have scores that are close to double digits (sometimes for both teams).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>2. New replay features</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/09/27/fifa18_replay.png" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This new feature is great tool for casters and new players. <em>FIFA 18</em> has a new &quot;Champions Channel&quot; feature that is similar to <em>Street Fighter</em>&#39;s Replay Channel. For the time being, it shows curated replays of players who have done well in FIFA Ultimate Team. It gives casters a chance to practice their craft using replays that are updated weekly and players can watch how better players perform so that they can learn from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h5><strong>3. Squad Battles</strong></h5>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/09/27/fifa18_squad.png" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another great addition for newer players or those who don&#39;t have access to really good, stable internet connection. &quot;Squad Battlers&quot; is a way for players to go against another player&#39;s FUT without directly competing against them. In this mode, players can get a taste of competing in FUT even though they are offline and the database will update daily with new featured teams to play against.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/09/27/fifa18_menu.png" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Those are just some of the the first impressions that our players got from playing in the early access period. There might be some issues that bugs everyone (goalies), but they&#39;re confident that things will get patched out soon. And they look forward to seeing what the community will come up with as people get their hands on it as well as casters/video producers practicing with replays (they look beautiful) with full control over the camera and speed.</p>	t	0.00353166481495919768	P	2017-09-27 18:18:55.143586+08	2017-09-27 19:24:36.434472+08	2017-09-27 18:30:00+08		595762464147451	13	9

    62	Winning Comes in Threes	Post-GameStart Asia FIFA 18 3v3 Tournament Interview with AmTuah.	Nicholas Thien	GameStart_AmTuah_Header.png	500	1300	1.0x0.49		winning-comes-threes	<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AmTuah.MY/">AmTuah</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fdg.shige/">Shige</a> headed South to Singapore to take part in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GameStart.Asia/">GameStart Asia</a>&rsquo;s FIFA tournaments. While they came up empty-handed in the 1v1, they managed to nab the championship of the 3v3 with fellow Malaysian competitor, Fenrir, from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamInfiniteMY/">Team INFINITE</a>. We sat down with Am to get a clearer idea on the lesser played 3v3 format.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/10/19/gamestart_groupshot.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>Shige (Left), Fenrir (Center) and AmTuah (Right) after their 3v3 win at Game.Start Asia.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Congrats on your win at the Gamestart FIFA 18&nbsp;3v3 Tournament. Did you guys prepare for it or was it a spur of the moment thing?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>AmTuah:</strong> <em>I think it seems like it was a last minute decision, but we had already set our sights on winning beforehand. We just had a stronger desire to win since we didn&#39;t want to leave the event empty-handed.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How often are 3v3 tournaments held?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>A:</strong> <em>From my experience, 3v3 is held like once a year and GameStart is where you would see it. So it was something we wanted to win since it doesn&rsquo;t happen that often.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How is 3v3 different from the regular 1v1 or 2v2 tournaments?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><em>It&rsquo;s not actually a real 3v3 match, due to the maximum number of players on the PlayStation 4 is four. The first half of the match is actually 1v1 and the 2nd half is 2v2. If there is a tie, then we would change who was playing for overtime. So in actual fact, it&rsquo;s not really that much different from 1v1.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How&rsquo;s playing with Fenrir? How was the chemistry playing with him?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><em>Fenrir is actually my old 2v2 teammate. So we&rsquo;re already familiar with each other and know the other&rsquo;s play style. It was to our advantage, because we had that history. Some teams just came in at the last minute, so we felt really confident in our chances and managed to claim the championship.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AmTuah will be playing this weekend&nbsp;at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1632617230116909/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A412747065557535%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A412747065557535%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D">KitaGamers Station&nbsp;&amp; Prodigy FIFA Gaming&#39;s&nbsp;FIFA 18 Offline Tournament</a>.</p>	t	0.000825803478445244097	P	2017-10-19 19:32:11.64043+08	2017-10-19 19:42:47.260007+08	2017-10-19 19:30:00+08		1846496202057895	13	9

Nicholas Thien	fdg101_esportsheader.jpg	533	1280	0.5x0.5	What is esports?	fdg101-01_what-esports	<p>If you clicked this link, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re curious about the world of esports and what it&rsquo;s about? What&rsquo;s up with the &ldquo;e&rdquo; in &ldquo;esports&rdquo;? You mean people just sit around and play games? Sit back and relax. All will be answered in due time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what is esports?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Esports is short for electronics sports. Essentially, they are any competitive events participated by professional gamers with the intent to win something that is of monetary value. Similar to how there&rsquo;s a difference between players just having fun kicking a ball on a field and the EPL or the FIFA World Cup. Basically, you play games against others and get paid to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What kind of games are there?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kind of games that are eligible for being played at the eSports level depends very much on two things. One, if the developers of the game designed a game in such a way that promotes team-based coordination and execution. And two, if it has a large enough community of players that are regularly playing the game competitively. Today, almost every company is trying to push a game or two as the next big esports competition but it&rsquo;s so hard to predict what game will hit at the right moment to gather the support to be an esports game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How did esports become the big industry it is now?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s all thanks to South Korea and StarCraft. While there might have been several games with competitive aspects to them that were popular like Street Fighter II, Quake, WarCraft III, Team Fortress and Counter-Strike. They were mostly events that were held privately in the player&rsquo;s own homes or in their local community. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t until right after the 1997 Asian Economic Crisis in South Korea, where the country invested heavily into the growth of their broadband infrastructure but at the time unemployment rates in the country were still high and therefore people were spending their time in cyber cafes or PC bangs instead of working. This sequence of events created the perfect conditions for birthing new talents in the field of esports as players were finding ample competition in the cyber cafes to improve their skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This growth was also helped along by the founding of the Korean e-Sports Association, an arm of South Korea&rsquo;s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, in 2000 to promote and regulate esports in the country. And from that, it became a booming industry in South Korea and as other countries started to improve their network infrastructure, more games were being developed with online competition and team play in mind and hence leading to where we are today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next time on FDG101, we will take a look at esports in relation to Malaysia.</p>	t	0.000265033364515353091	P	2017-05-30 13:02:57.737288+08	2017-07-03 23:37:08.829036+08	2017-05-30 13:01:06+08		1414874358560869	9	1

    64	World's Quarterfinals Recap	Korean Drama and the End of a Cinderella Story	Luqman "Crowe" Abdullah	Korean-Drama-and-the-End-of-a-Cinderella-Story.png	500	1300	0.5x0.5		worlds-quarterfinals-recap	<p>Quarterfinals were in full swing last weekend seeing China and Korea send their teams through to the Semifinals, while the LCS regions were sent packing in Guangzhou. Here is a look at some of the more interesting story lines from last weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tournament Favorites Longzhu are Sent Packing by Samsung Galaxy:</strong><br />\r\nSamsung Galaxy made quick work of the tournament favourites Longzhu, sweeping aside the LCK Summer Champs 3-0 in the quarterfinals. Ruler had his Worlds&#39; &quot;coming out&quot; party, smashing team fights and ending the series with a KDA of 17, highest of all the Quarterfinals participants. Longzhu stars Khan and BDD finished with KDAs of 2.1 and 2.5 respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SKT Bleeds:</strong><br />\r\nSK Telecom 1 limped into the Semifinals after having bested the European 2nd seed 3-2. A disgruntled Kkoma said during his interview following the series that he &quot;should have been a better coach&quot; and multiple members of SKT have apologized to their fans for what they are calling a &quot;poor showing&quot;. To Misfits&#39; credit, SKT is widely regarded as one of the most difficult teams to defeat in a best of 5, and the team seemed up to the task, digging into their bag of tricks in the form of Leona, Blitzcrank, and Ivern, but came up just short of possibly one of the greatest upsets in Worlds&#39; history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Home Team Marches on:</strong><br />\r\nChina&#39;s Royal Never Giveup (RNG) and World Elite (WE) both advanced to the semifinals. RNG put an end to Fnatic&#39;s miracle run while World Elite held off Cloud 9&amp;&#39;s unconventional draft tactics to take the series 3-2 after falling 2-1 earlier in the series. Cloud 9 handed the hometown team Galio, Kog&#39;maw &amp; Janna in the final game in exchange for Lulu, Caitlyn &amp; Jensen&#39;s Orianna. A trade that WE gladly accepted, trouncing the final NA team from Worlds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The stage is set for an all Asia showdown, with 2 Chinese and 2 Korean teams remaining in the Worlds&#39; Knockout Stage. RNG will face off against SKT, a rematch of the 2013 Worlds Finals and World Elite square off with Samsung Galaxy, who looked like the team of destiny last week.

Jeffery "Vyprex" Chan	LoL_Header.jpg	500	1300	0.5x0.5	The 2017 Fire Dragoon League of Legends roster.	league-legends-roster-release	<p>This would probably come as a surprise but effective today, the entirety of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FDGLOL/">Fire Dragoon (FDG) League of Legends&rsquo; (LoL)</a> roster would be released from their contract. The 2017 season has concluded with the team placing 5th in the <a href="http://tlcmy.garena.com/">The Legends Circuit (TLC) MY</a>, and we thank all our players for their commitment and the sacrifices that they&rsquo;ve made for the organisation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This means that the roster of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nekoko.mina/">Jason &ldquo;Neko&rdquo; Chong</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/xarelol/">Jonathan &ldquo;Xare&rdquo; Chan</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100013121944816">Jacob &ldquo;JLKC&rdquo; Low</a>, Joshua &ldquo;Ribena&rdquo; Chan, Lim &ldquo;Hoki26&rdquo; Tou Jye, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VitaAzure/">Melvin &ldquo;Vita&rdquo; Yong</a> and Soon &ldquo;Scorp&rdquo; Zhen Suan would no longer be part of the FDG LoL lineup.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The LoL team is something very dear to the organization, and I daresay that FDG would not be in existence without them. It was through our first LoL roster that the organization made our inception into esports. Familiar names like Xeno and ShiNe were some of the players whom we were proud of, but got eventually picked up by Mineski-X (now known as Nirvana Gaming).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, the sole reason of me being in FDG was due to a request to rebuild the LoL team. The plan was simple, to rebuild the squad with the sole aim to challenge the best team in the country, Kuala Lumpur Hunters (KLH).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As part of our core values, FDG believes in grooming young talents, into polished diamonds. During the recruitment and tryouts, several players who were deemed to have potential and passionate were invited to join the roster. Our commitment to the players was to mold them into contenders for the top spot in the region. In fact, I recall telling the players to believe in the organization as the catalyst for their success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, we failed to deliver. Going into the season, we did not secure a coaching staff for the team, and most of the time, players were left to fend for themselves. Situations were so dire that players were dying for the management to step in and direct them but by the time we found out, it was already too late.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining FDG, for the players, was a giant leap of faith. Most, if not all the players who joined FDG in TLC Summer understood well of the implications in joining the team. They were given this &ldquo;single&nbsp;opportunity&rdquo; to pursue esports with FDG, before being called by their parents to return to college or rejoin the workforce. There was a specific player who made a truce with his parents on &ldquo;giving up competitive esports if FDG does not work out&rdquo; and it is regrettable that we could not help them realize their dreams, and up until today, I am not able to shake off the voice of the players telling me of the promises made, prior to them joining the organization, which was left unfulfilled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has all come to past, and this incident serves as a lesson for myself, and the organization. It is through this, that we improve, and vow to never let such incident from happening ever again. It is a shame that they are the ones who have to bear the consequences of our inexperience. On a personal note, I would like to offer my deepest apology to the players who trusted us, yet today, leaving the organization disappointed. Although short, it has been an interesting journey, and I wish everyone all the best in your future endeavors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for FDG LoL, there is no plans as of yet but we will keep you informed when there&rsquo;s any moving forward. Thank you to everyone who have been supporting the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/vyprex/"><em>Jeffery &ldquo;Vyprex&rdquo; Chan</em></a><br />\r\nGeneral Manager<br />\r\nFire Dragoon Esports</p>	t	0.0135128702418021857	P	2017-10-03 17:52:06.698666+08	2017-10-03 18:50:01.133876+08	2017-10-03 18:50:00+08		860202347469950	1	9

    65	Overwatch | Redbull Coliseum Pre-Tournament Interview	It's gonna be high noon this weekend as Malaysia plays host to SEA's best Overwatch teams at the Redbull Coliseum Overwatch tournament.	Nicholas Thien	Overwatch_Redbull_Header.png	500	1300	0.5x0.5		overwatch-redbull-coliseum-pre-tournament-interview	<p>This weekend, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FDGOW/">Fire Dragoon Overwatch</a> team will be competing at the Red Bull Coliseum where they will take on some of SEA&#39;s top Overwatch teams &nbsp;It&rsquo;s been awhile since the qualifier where we last heard from the FDG team, let&rsquo;s check in and see how they&rsquo;re doing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How goes the prep for the tournament?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Overwatch Team:</strong> <em>It&#39;s going well, ever since the qualifiers we&#39;ve been putting the time into doing scrims and training. We&#39;re limited by the time we can put in together because of our other commitments but I think that has kept us focused. Because we know that we only have a set time to do stuff, we try to make the most out of the training sessions.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How is the competition from the rest of Asian region different compared to just playing locally?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>OT:</strong> <em>I think the biggest difference between Overwatch teams in Malaysia and the rest of the region is the skill gap. What makes Overwatch different from other esport games like Dota and League of Legends is that you can change your heroes mid-match, and because of this, the flow of the game is frequently changing.<br />\r\nAnd it is how fast a team adapts to the changing situation that&#39;s makes the&nbsp;difference&nbsp;from Malaysian Overwatch and those from the rest of the region. Because of the lack of experience dealing with the different hero compositions, we tend to stick to our main heroes. But the other teams have had much more experience and they are not only good with their main, they&#39;re good with their secondary and tertiary heroes as well and that&#39;s where the skill gap comes in.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So what should we look out for in terms of hero composition or team matchups?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>OT:</strong> <em>While we have seen Mercy take up a more dominating presence in hero comp lately, the game is still about reading the situation and adapting to it quickly. So while certain hero comps are more suitable for certain maps, there is still a wide variation due to player skill and experience.<br />\r\nAs for team match-ups, we feel that a lot of the regional teams are quite comparable in terms of skill. So every game should be exciting to watch as the higher level teams would be proficient with many different heroes that we won&rsquo;t see the same matchup come up again and again. There&#39;s not one strategy that works 100% of the time, for e.g. now Mercy is popular because of the recent buffs but a good team would adapt to that and find ways to overcome that comp.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there a higher pressure to perform since you&#39;re playing on home turf against such odds?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>OT:</strong> <em>There&#39;s always a pressure to perform, but we know that we can only do so much. So all we focus on is to do the best we can when it&#39;s our time to shine and hope for the best. The better team will always come out on top so we just have to step up our game.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are your hopes coming out of the event?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>OT:</strong> <em>While we obviously hope that we will come out on top, I think more importantly it&#39;s to give our audience a look at high level play of Overwatch and hopefully from there, start a fire in new players to pick up the game.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Thank you for your time, good luck this weekend.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>OT:</strong> <em>Thank you.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tournament will be held at Sunway Pyramid starting this Friday with the opening ceremony. Teams from all over Asia including Singapore, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia will be taking part in the tournament as well.</p>	t	0.00141565288224614213	P	2017-10-25 17:31:14.495688+08	2017-10-25 19:21:28.354315+08	2017-10-25 19:00:00+08		508963106137242	7	9

Along with 7 other teams from all over Asia, they will be taking part in the Main Event on the 8th of July at the <em>Orange Stadium, Setapak</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seeing their first LAN action after months of online competitions, the team participated in the B5 Battle Arena LAN Qualifier after not being able to make the grade in the <em>Online Qualifiers</em>. While it was disappointing that we only managed to see the team play&nbsp;in only one game against <em>MetamorphiC Gaming</em>, the team still showed their prowess by defeating them &nbsp;16 to 8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>League of Legends</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For their last match in <em>The&nbsp;Legends Circuit MY Summer 2017 Group Stage</em>, <em>Fire Dragoon&#39;s League of Legends</em> team went against <em>Orange Esports </em><em>Swestic</em> but was defeated in both of their games. After the shakeup of the week&rsquo;s matches, the team was pushed out of the playoff spot and landed on 5th place. Ending their debut season in the group stages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the group stage, the team managed to score a total of 8 points out of the possible 21 points. Winning 2 matches and drawing 2 out of the 7 matches. With the group stages coming to an end, it also marks the end for most of the team&rsquo;s participation in events for the rest of the year. We wish our team all the best and hope to see them come back stronger next year. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Dota 2 </strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking part in the <em>WCA 2017 APAC Region Open Qualification</em>, the Fire Dragoon&#39;s <em>Dota 2</em> team was knocked out in the&nbsp;round of 16 by <em>KchatNo1</em> in the <em>1st Qualification</em> and later in the week they were knocked out of the quarterfinals of the <em>2nd Qualification</em> by the Filipino team, <em>YMFI</em>.</p>	t	0.00051392585016760855	P	2017-07-04 18:50:16.200795+08	2017-07-04 19:05:13.29053+08	2017-07-04 19:00:00+08		315693242204034	10	1

Although, having played with or been a part of teams that have made it to the top stages of the International, they have yet to hold the storied <em>Aegies</em> in their own hands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is precisely that hunger for success, which drives them to join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/firedragoonesports/"><em>Fire Dragoon</em></a> Dota 2 roster and strive towards achieving the vision of wanting to be the first full Malaysian team to compete on the main stage at The International after the previous iteration of Team Malaysia by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/mushichai/"><em>Chai &ldquo;Mushi&rdquo; Yee Fung</em></a>, whose team was then acquired by Fnatic and everything else was history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RUrG2u-gqIA" width="100%"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<p>adam and AhJit are both joined together with the current players on the roster, South East Asia&rsquo;s 9K MMR player, <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlaCrityyyyyy/">Hiew &quot;&rsquo;AlaCrity-&quot; Teck Yoong</a></em> together with FDG&rsquo;s veterans, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrayaNtPang/"><em>Pang &ldquo;</em></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrayaNtPang/"><em>BrayaNt</em></a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BrayaNtPang/"><em>&rdquo; Jian Zhe</em></a> and <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/yangliangying">Yang &ldquo;yaNG&rdquo; Liang Ying</a></em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After less than 1 week of training together, the team joined their first official tournament last weekend at the <em><a href="http://www.mesl.my/">Malaysian Esports League</a></em> Qualifiers in Selangor alongside 63 other aspiring Dota 2 teams, which was organized by the <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MineskiEventsTeamMalaysia/">Mineski Events Team</a></em>.

Answering the call was <em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chua.s.khong">Raphael &quot;KanGaroo&quot; Chua</a></em>, our new Divine ranked off-laner.

What&rsquo;s your history with each other?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Ahjit:</strong> <em>We&#39;ve known each other for about 2 years now, we used to be rivals in the local tournaments.

Looking back to the past, we started off as an organisation that consist of teams training online from home, shifted into a gaming house in the outskirts of Selangor and right now, at the center of Petaling Jaya.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building an esports organisation takes a lot of time, effort and passion - and we will not deny that diving deep into the esports industry at this stage is a daunting task.

It was Malaysia&rsquo;s very first Cyber Games festival that is supported by the government so it&rsquo;s a big thing for gamers. They did competitions for many game titles namely CSGO, Dota 2, Ultra Street Fighter and FIFA16. That very year, Amirul &ldquo;AmTuah&rdquo; Afandi participated in the FIFA16 and came out as the champion of the tournament bringing home RM10,000 with him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: <a href="https://www.esportsearnings.com/tournaments/15914-malaysia-cyber-games-2015-fifa">MCG FIFA16 results</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>3 years later, MCG is back bigger and better to bring us more excitement and entertainment with more game titles and a bigger prize pool. Guess who will make a return at this year&rsquo;s MCG to defend his title? Our very own AmTuah of course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="308" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/hafiz/2018/01/10/25626810_739387176252352_5120087387264868451_o.jpg" width="205" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>AmTuah can hardly contain his enthusiasm to join MCG this year. He has been training every day in preparation to defend his title. Even though practicing in the office is his usual daily routine, you know he&rsquo;s getting serious when he starts calling in people and favors to find scrim partners as preparation for the coming tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The win in MCG 2015 was his own. This year, he will be playing under the banner of FDG with&nbsp;his partner and friend, Lim &ldquo;Shige&rdquo; Boon Shin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="313" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/hafiz/2018/01/10/24130320_727571967433873_832906666850427497_o.jpg" width="470" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being one of the best players in Malaysia is no small feat and definitely not a small thing that can be overlooked. As his partner is gearing up towards the coming competition, Shige also kicked up a notch with his training regime so that he will be prepared with anything (or anyone) that comes at him this coming week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time both of the FIFA18 players will be heading to PWTC to compete under Fire Dragoon instead of under their own name. They will be doing their best to grab the win to make a statement in the FIFA18 esports scene that FDG doesn&rsquo;t mess around.</p>	t	0.00592527523670093644	P	2018-01-10 18:58:16.305104+08	2018-01-12 13:03:51.99426+08	2018-01-10 18:58:15+08		158985594877458	14	18
