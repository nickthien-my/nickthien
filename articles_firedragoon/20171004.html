Since then they have struggled to recapture a championship level of play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year&#39;s <a href="https://lol.gamepedia.com/2017_Mid-Season_Invitational">Mid Season Invitational</a> serves as a perfect example of TSM struggling to make it to the main event of the play-in stage and failed to make the knockout stage after that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a lot to like about TSM at Worlds this year. They are coming off of a convincing <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/League_Championship_Series/North_America/2017_Season/Summer_Playoffs">NA LCS final</a> where they dispatched <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Immortals">Immortals</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epXDVIPDatY">3-1</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&#39;ve been taking the time to focus on playing a variety of compositions instead of getting very good at a singular type of composition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To top it all off, at the beginning of the Summer split they welcomed back their star marksmen, <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Doublelift">Doublelift</a>. This came after seeing <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Hauntzer">Hauntzer</a> take on a much more vocal role in the team, which resulted in him putting up a near MVP worthy performance over the course of the season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They appear to be head and shoulders above the rest of the very competitive NA LCS scene, but the same question still rings true for TSM; &ldquo;Is it enough?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TSM has not made it out of the Group Stage since <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/2015_Season_World_Championship">2015</a> where they were quickly ousted from the tournament by the eventual World Champions, <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Samsung_White">Samsung White (SSW)</a>. (Note: TSM gave SSW their only loss during their near flawless run to a title).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the draw seems to be in the team&#39;s favor this time around. They were picked into a group with the <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Flash_Wolves">Flash Wolves</a>, <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Team_WE">Team WE (World Elite)</a> and <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Misfits_(European_Team)">Misfits</a>. Meaning they are in a group without any Korean teams, the less threatening of the two European finalists; World Elite, who qualified through the play-in phase; and the Flash Wolves, whom while they seem to be <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/SK_Telecom_T1">SK Telecom T1 (SKT)</a>&#39;s kryptonite, have struggled to look as dominant against other teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The odds certainly seem to be in their favor when compared to their past group draws which paired them with the likes of two time world finalist <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Royal_Never_Give_Up">Royal Never Give-up</a>, <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy">Samsung Galaxy</a>, <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/KT_Rolster">KT Rolster</a>, and <a href="https://lol.esportspedia.com/wiki/Origen">Origen</a>, who, in case you forgot, managed to reach the semifinals in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That being said, if all goes well TSM could be in prime position to make a run at a World Championship and finally give their fans a long awaited knockout stage appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/luqman.abdullah1">Luqman &quot;Crowe&quot; Abdullah</a> is a former manager of the&nbsp;Kuala Lumpur Hunters.</p>	t	0.00144386676599549905	P	2017-10-04 15:21:26.283451+08	2017-10-04 18:10:32.126565+08	2017-10-04 18:00:00+08		904529969696167	1	9
