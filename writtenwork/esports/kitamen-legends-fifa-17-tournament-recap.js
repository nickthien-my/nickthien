        "output": "Last weekend, our two <em>FIFA 17</em> players played off against each other in the grand finals of the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/events/1401143979963025/'>Kitamen Legends FIFA 17 Tournament</a>. It was one of the main gaming events held during the <a href='http://www.vax.asia/'>Visual Arts Expo 2017</a> which took place at the Shah Alam Convention Center.<br>The tournament started on Saturday morning by whittling down the 64 competitors to the 32 who will be competing in the elimination rounds on Sunday. It was fortuitous that our two <em>FIFA 17</em> players were placed in separate branches or else we wouldn't have gotten the chance to see these two titans facing off against each other in the finals.<br>As the duo made their way through to the front of the pack, competition continued to be fierce but there was little doubt that we would be seeing a matchup between our two <em>FIFA 17</em> players. It's been a while since we've last seen these two go head-to-head in a tournament setting, so it was a treat that doesn't come around often enough.<br>It was <a href='https://www.facebook.com/FFshige/'>Boon Shin \"Shige\"</a> with his Manchester United team versus <a href='https://www.facebook.com/AmTuah.MY'>Amirul \"AmTuah\" Afandi</a> and his Real Madrid team. In the first game, it was scoreless until Shige managed to score with Man U striker, Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ‡ in the closing stages of the second half, providing him with a 1-0 lead, AmTuah would attempt to retaliate but sadly he was short of time.<br>In the second round, AmTuah would be the one striking the first blow with RMFC striker, Karim Benzema, after a few back and forths in the first half. But it would not be more than 10 minutes of in-game time before Shige would sink a long range shot with Man U midfielder, Henrikh Mkhitaryan. Tieing the game 1-1 before the first half was over.<br>Not long after the beginning of the second half that Shige would find another goal with Man U midfielder, Ander Herrera. AmTuah would attempt a few attacks on Shige's goal but he managed to withstand the pressure and defend against AmTuah's attempts.<br>In the final moments of the second half, a header with Man U forward, Anthony Martial, would seal the win for Shige. Finishing off the game 3-1 in regular time. Shige was crowned the champion with a score of 2-0 after two heart pounding games.<br>Shige walks away with the grand prize of Rm3,000 and AmTuah gets the runner-up prize of Rm1,500.",
