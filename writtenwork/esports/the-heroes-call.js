Together with the actual game itself, the team has been getting quite a bit of exposure lately due to the multitude of events that the Overwatch community here in Malaysia has been having.<br>Although it's one of the youngest esports community compared to the rest, it is one of the fastest growing. We thought that it would be a good opportunity now leading up to C2AGE X-Treme to showcase some of the bigger events that our team has played at and take a look at some of the upcoming Overwatch competitions happening locally as well as globally.",

Overwatch is also one of the currently most cosplayed game right now because of how diverse the characters are in the game from all different backgrounds, shapes, and ages. So you can't find a better game to showcase at the event than Overwatch.",

Sadly, Malaysia was ineligible for qualification this year. Qualification is based on the average Skill Ratings of the top 100 players in the country, but Malaysia's players did not have a high enough average to beat out the other eligible countries.<br>The first match of the group stages will start this weekend in Shanghai.",
