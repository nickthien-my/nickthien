Australia, New Zealand, China, India, and Korea to name&nbsp;a few of the countries that will be participating in the tournament.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/11/02/iesflol001.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they start their one week intense training at the FDG offices, we wanted to get to know the team better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Could you guys give us a short introduction to yourselves?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>Team Rough Life:</strong> <em>We&#39;re Team Rough Life, we&#39;re a Malaysian League of Legends team that qualified for the ieSF in August. We found each other online, had passion for&nbsp;LoL&nbsp;and just formed a team.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Congratulations on qualifying for the ieSF, it must be pretty exciting for you guys?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>TRL:</strong> <em>Thank you, we&#39;re really excited to go. We didn&rsquo;t really expect to qualify but it happened and we&rsquo;re just enjoying the ride. We were surprised to get a call from Fire Dragoon that they opened their doors for us to train.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did you expect all this when you guys first got the call?</strong><br />\r\n<strong>TRL:</strong> <em>I think we just expected that it was going just using the equipment in the office to play and that&rsquo;s it. We didn&rsquo;t expect to have a gaming house provided and best of all a coach! We were really surprised when we came in and we were told that we would be coached by the one and only Crowe!<br />\r\nWe&rsquo;ve also been really taken care of. We were told that if we had any problems we could just contact them, but everything&rsquo;s been taken care of so well that we haven&rsquo;t found much problem. We could just focus on playing and not worry about anything else.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>That&rsquo;s really good to hear, I&rsquo;ll talk to you guys again before you guys leave to see how you guys are doing Thank you.</strong><br />\r\n<strong>TRL:</strong> <em>Thank you!</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="https://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/11/02/iesflol.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Team Rough Life is comprised of:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>TOP : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Jus.TZX">Justin &#39;RL jarlax&#39; Tung</a></li>\r\n\t<li>JUNGLE : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Loo.kahyew1">Loo &lsquo;RL Lavender&rsquo; Kah Yew</a></li>\r\n\t<li>MID : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/yap.liyaw">Yap &lsquo;RL Arxues&rsquo; Li Aw</a></li>\r\n\t<li>ADC : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/myhero.myboss">Khoo &lsquo;RL Albin&rsquo; El Bin</a></li>\r\n\t<li>SP : <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LewisLife24">Louis &lsquo;RL Imanotgod&rsquo; Wong</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The interview was conducted in Mandarin and was translated and edited for clarity.</em></p>	t	0.00446133972236421351	P	2017-11-02 16:34:35.429529+08	2017-11-02 17:04:13.200418+08	2017-11-02 15:00:00+08		147125056034996	1	9
