They went up against 4moD on Friday night, resulting in a draw with 4moD winning the first game and on Saturday afternoon, the team went against Eternity Esport but was defeated 0 to 2.<br>Coming off a 4 game winning streak, hopes were high during the week that at least one of the two matches from last week's TLC MY 2017 Group Stage would have been a win to secure a spot in the playoffs but the roller coaster of emotions continue in TLC MY 2017 as the top 6 rankings continue to fluctuate without any of the teams managing to break away from the pack other than Kuala Lumpur Hunters.<br>With the teams so close in point totals, we won't know the outcome of the team until the very end of the group stages.",

        "output": "Participating in two Open Qualifiers over the week, the Fire Dragoon <em>Dota 2</em> team was unfortunately unable to qualify for the Main Qualifiers of The International 2017. They made it up to the round of 32 in the first group and managed to breach the top 8 in the second group.<br>Walking into a literal lion's den, with every team hungry for a chance in the spotlight that is TI17. It would be a tall ask for any team to go against the best of the best of the SEA region. It was a gruelling marathon with matches played back to back as soon as the teams were ready to go. With a single elimination format that necessitated teams to think quickly on their feet and adjust to what their opponents were throwing at them.<br>While it was disappointing that the team didn't manage to qualify and move onto the next round, it was great experience going against teams with a variety of makeups from all over Asia. But with all things Dota 2, there's little time to rest and lick their wounds before the next tournament will come around the corner.",
