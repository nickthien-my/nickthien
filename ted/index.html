    <h4>Another year around the block, another year older.</h4>

    <p>While 35 isn't as significant as 16 or 21... or even the 1st month or year in the grand scheme of things. Making it through the past 12 months isn't any less significant to me, learning some very important lessons in life that I hope I'll be able to carry with me for the rest of my life.</p>

    <p>As we all know perfectly well, we've all been in lockdown for the past year or so... even making it past the 500 days mark not too long ago. So we've all been cooped up at home, most of us spending it in front of our screens working and socializing. But when the screens go dead and we have to return to reality, we're faced with family members or loved ones who have been there on a near daily basis. At times never leaving our sights even for a moment if no one has their own personal offices to go to. And let's be honest, as much as we love them and some made vows to do so til their deaths, 24/7 together is a little bit much.</p>

    <p>And for me, there's this one guy (Let's call him, Ted) that I've been living with a long time now. He has no concept of personal space, shoves his head into your business when you least expect it and worst of all, he's abusive as hell. Ted is like your worst nightmare housemate manifested into life.</p>

    <p>And it sucks living with him, usually I get to escape this guy by going to work, hanging out with friends or by just going to a restaurant and have my meals. But with the pandemic lockdown in full force, I have to be at home, at work, at meals with Ted all day. And oh boy was it a nightmare. Everyday I had shade being thrown at me, every decision I made was being questioned and it just made me feel terrible inside.</p>

    <p>I wanted to get out as soon as possible, I wanted this pandemic to end so that I can be away from Ted. And as we all know that was not the case and the pandemic went on... and it got worst. Without seeing any light at the end of the tunnel,  I fell into a deeper pit of despair. I asked myself whether or not any of this suffering was worth it? Should I stay or should I leave this toxic relationship?</p>

    <p>But the problem was... Ted was me. I was the one being toxic to myself. Abusive to myself. Highlighting every flaw, every mistake that I made. So I couldn't leave even if I wanted to and I didn't have the outside world to distract me from what Ted was saying. I couldn't just ignore him while I went to work or come home tired and ask for some private time. Ted was just... there.</p>

    <p>I had to do something. It was do or die at this point cause one of us wasn't going to  make it out alive at the end if we kept going down this path. If we have to live with each other for the rest of our lives then we had to set boundaries for each other. It was tough for me, but I had to love Ted for what he brings to my life and Ted had to learn to not just bring up the negatives but also the positives.</p>

    <p>There are days when Ted still blurts out some really toxic s*t and I have to accept Ted for who he is. But at least there are days when Ted says something nice and I'm less agitated when he doesn't do what he's supposed to do. We're imperfect, but we're trying our best to work through it by communicating with each other and the end result is that I'm learning to love myself more.</p>
