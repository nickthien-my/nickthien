32	The Rise and Fall of Esports	Esports is a rapidly growing industry, but it could all crumble in an instant.	Nicholas Thien	E-Sports-Featured-1024x576.jpg	576	1024	0.5x0.5		rise-and-fall-esports	<p>Last week, Disney announced that they would be joining forces with ESL and numerous other gaming outlets to bring gaming programming, which includes esports, to their Disney XD channel for the summer. Before that Street Fighter V and Super Smash Bros. Finals were being aired on ESPN (a subsidiary of Disney) and Disney XD, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Closer to home, TGV Cinemas will be broadcasting Dota 2&#39;s The International 2017 finals at selected venues next month to coincide with the event. The last time a live event was broadcast in such a public manner was during Lee Chong Wei&#39;s Badminton Finals at Olympics last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The latest prize pool at The International 2017 totaling close to USD22 million, or around Rm94 million, breaking the previous year&#39;s record of USD21 million with almost a month of crowdfunding left to go. In Overwatch, analysts are predicting that the league will bring in close to USD720 million in revenue annually.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just some of the examples as to how esports is gaining momentum, both in terms of mainstream exposure and financially, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be losing steam any time soon. But like any industry, there&#39;s a risk of stagnation and that could lead to the industry faltering faster than when it was blossoming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we can&#39;t speak to what other countries are doing to nurture the esports industry, we can pinpoint a few areas that could do with some improvements over here in Malaysia. Do take note that these are just some of the general pitfalls that many sporting industry fall into if they are not careful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1) Nurturing new talent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The industry grows when the pool of competition within a country is abundant enough to sustain it. With fresh blood constantly entering the scene, it not only livens up the industry by the changes in the way the game is played by introducing new players but it also attracts new spectators who want to root for players who are closer to their age and they relate to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But sadly, the industry as a whole in Malaysia is still struggling with creating a community that will train and nurture talent from a young age and provide them with the means to perform and make the most of their potential. And with the retirement age of players relatively young compared to other forms of sports, it shortens the amount of time that players can play at an internationally competitive level before they have to retire.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2) Keeping the talent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the esports industry is still relatively new compared to other forms of sports, the industry doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s fair share of prestigious competitions yet. In football, you have the World Cup. In tennis, Wimbledon. Even the Olympics, caters to a wide range of sporting events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In esports, while there are tournaments like The International for Dota 2, EVO for fighting games and the World Cup for Overwatch. There&#39;s still a lack of widespread awareness for esports which is why Disney taking charge and showcasing some esports games on their channel is a great boon for building the public perception of esports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All this is just to say that, to keep our esports talents from burning out, we need to show that we appreciate the work that they do. Winning competitions helps in building their morale and with financial support. But it&#39;s unfortunate that a majority of esports competitions are only known to the select few who are in the know and in general, we do a bad job at letting the public know about them. And this leads to players not seeing the purpose or have the motivation to pursue a career in esports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3) Enlightening the Masses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, is building public awareness for our players. So that when their parents or aunties and uncles ask them what they do, they can proudly say to them, &quot;I&#39;m an esports athlete!&quot; It might seem superficial at first, why would the players need affirmation if they are doing what they love. But it goes a long way for the longevity of the players that make up the industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By removing the stigma of having a career in esports, it frees up the players to pursue a career in a more balanced and mature manner and potentially having their family actually provide moral and financial support to them. The burden becomes less on the players to scrounge up whatever they can to start their career and they could even start their careers earlier and spend an even longer time playing before having to retire.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This understanding also lessens the pressure from relatives, seeing it as using the prime of their life to perform and allowing them to focus rather than having to explain why they aren&#39;t working in a career that provides a &quot;future&quot; for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are just some of the points that we, the industry, as a whole can be better at. We&#39;re trying our best at Fire Dragoon to not only train our players to be the best at their games but also to educate and support our players to help them pursue a lifelong career in esports similar to what mainstream sports athletes have done.</p>	t	0	W	2017-07-24 19:31:10.123916+08	2017-07-25 15:07:51.320833+08	2017-07-24 19:30:00+08			11	9
