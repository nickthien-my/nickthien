In the first round of 128, the team had a bye and advanced to the next round where they would face fellow Malaysian team, <em>Virtual Genesis Esports</em>, in the round of 64. The team managed to beat VG, 16&ndash;10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later that evening in the round of 32, the team went against Vietnamese team, <em>UTM </em><em>CS:GO</em>, one of the biggest professional esports team in Vietnam. UTM blew past the CSGO team and was eliminated from the qualifier with the final score of 8&ndash;16. The team finished in the Top 32 and is unable to qualify for the main WCA 2017 APAC event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>FIFA17</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the weekend, the <em>FIFA17</em> duo had two events. The first event was <em>Gamesbro</em>&#39;s<em> FIFA17 Tournament</em> that was held at <em>Gamesbro</em> on Saturday. <em>Amirul &quot;AmTuah&quot; Afandi</em> was sadly knocked out early in the top 32 by <em>Falcon Esports</em> representative, <em>KaizerHaz</em>, who was knocked out by another fellow <em>Falcon Esports</em> player in the next round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Boon Shin &quot;Shige&quot;</em> would see more action at <em>Gamesbro</em>, after the group stages. His first game was against <em>Prodigy FIFA Gaming</em>&#39;s <em>Ace</em>. <em>Shige</em> beats&nbsp;<em>Ace</em>, 5&ndash;3. In the round of 16, <em>Shige</em> would help his fellow teammate take back a win from <em>Falcon Esports</em> by beating their representative, <em>Dakwos</em>, 3&ndash;1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing his winning streak, <em>Shige</em> would next face <em>Kickers</em>&#39; <em>Abul</em>. Going 1&ndash;1 in normal time, they would head into the penalty shootout with <em>Shige</em> coming out on top and moving on to the semifinals. Shige had hoped to go 4 for 4 against the esports companies that are competing in <em>Gamesbro</em> by beating <em>Infinite Esports</em>&#39; <em>Nakata</em>. Sadly, <em>Shige</em> was unable to overcome the champion of the tournament. Losing to <em>Nakata</em>, 3&ndash;1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that lost, <em>Shige</em> was sent to the loser&#39;s final to compete for third place against <em>Prodigy</em>&#39;s <em>Sora</em>. <em>Shige</em> managed to defeat <em>Sora,</em>&nbsp;ultimately achieving the second runner-up position.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="360" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/18/gamesbro.jpg" width="640" />\r\n<figcaption><em>Shige </em>accepting the prize for 2nd runner-up position.

On Saturday, the team only had one game against <em>5F1M</em> and won their first match in the tournament and advanced to the winner bracket finals on Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the winner bracket finals, the team went against <em>SoloQ Gaming</em>, who the team defeated last month during <em>Midnight Gaming</em>&#39;s <em>Jom Main! Overwatch Tournament</em>. So there is definitely a desire from the opposing team to overcome the team. The team managed to hold their ground and sent <em>SoloQ</em> to the loser&#39;s finals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This would not be the last time that the teams meet. As <em>SoloQ</em> proved their tenacity by beating <em>Malaysian Battlefield Team - Mixed Team</em> in the loser&#39;s finals and faced off against the team one more time in the grand finals. However, <em>SoloQ </em>was unable to find a winning solution for the <em>FDG </em>team and the team beat <em>SoloQ</em>, 3&ndash;0, and ended the day as the champions of the tournament.</p>\r\n\r\n<div style="text-align:center">\r\n<figure class="image" style="display:inline-block"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/nickthien/2017/07/18/overwatch_c2age.jpg" width="1280" />\r\n<figcaption>The Overwatch team.
