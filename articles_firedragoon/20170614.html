Way before the prominence of <em>Counter-Strike</em>, when the world first heard of &#39;<em>Fatal1ty</em>&#39; and &#39;<em>Thresh</em>&#39; as viable in-game names. There was <em>Quake</em>. The last Quake game to be released was <em>Quake Live</em>, a remake of <em>Quake III Arena</em>. Quake never really took off here in Asia because many of us weren&#39;t born or never got to experience the joys of dial-up internet during the hey-days of <em>Quake II</em> and Quake III: Arena instead focusing on LAN play that Counter-Strike provided. Plus it didn&#39;t help that it&#39;s such a fast game of kills and respawns that if there was any lag at all it kills the momentum of the game which centered around quick-reflexes, pin-point accuracy and item spawn management.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px"><em>Quake Champions</em> adds &#39;Champions&#39; into the mix with their unique attributes and skills to attract newer players who are more used to current shooters and other games that have heroes with unique playstyles. Will all these addition finally help Quake regain it&#39;s former position as a top tier esports games or will have gamers moved on from old-school twitch gameplay?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Dragon Ball FighterZ</span></strong></u></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" height="720" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/14/dbfz.jpg" width="1280" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Probably the biggest surprise at <em>E3 2017</em> this year. After half a decade of <em>Xenoverse </em>games, <em>Dragon Ball</em> fans have gotten used to DBZ games being 3D arena fighting games that are sluggish and focus more on retelling of the manga and anime in 3D animated form. So it came as a huge surprise that<em> Namco Bandai</em> announced <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>, a fighting game&nbsp;being developed by <em>Arc System Works</em>, well known in the realm of the fighting game community for games like <em>Guilty Gear</em>, <em>Blazblue</em> and <em>Persona 4: Arena</em>. Featuring stunning 3D graphics that could be easily mistaken for 2D sprites, it features 3v3 battles similar to the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series and some might argue takes the hyperactive action of that series and multiplies it by a thousand fold.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px">While it remains to be seen if the developers will lean more hardcore or casual friendly, it definitely caught the attention of many fighting game fans hungry for a flashy fighting game action after the lackluster showings from <em>Capcom</em>&#39;s <em>Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite</em> failed to deliver.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:18px"><u><strong><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">PlayerUnknown&#39;s Battlegrounds</span></strong></u></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src="http://www.firedragoon.com/media/admin/2017/06/14/pubg.jpg" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">While everyone and their mom probably knows about <em>PlayerUnknown&#39;s Battlegrounds</em> at this point, it doesn&#39;t hurt that it was given a big boost in exposure to the general public by being featured as an exclusive at <em>Microsoft</em>&#39;s Press Conference. While the rng aspects and lack of spectator options gives pause as to whether or not it will be a serious contender in terms of esports or it&#39;ll just remain as a streamer&#39;s darling, with an announcement of exclusivity on Microsoft&#39;s console indicating that there will be an influx of financial support to get the game out on their system will also reap rewards for the PC market as they will focus on adding more features and bug fixes.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px">While there are fears that every time a PC first game get&#39;s ported over to a console, it will dumb down the experience on the PC. Let&#39;s hope the development team is smart about what they bring back into the PC version from their experience developing on console, especially the polish that you might not get from developing for the PC hardware.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:14px">What did you see from E3 2017 that got you excited?
