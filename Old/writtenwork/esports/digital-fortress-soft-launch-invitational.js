We really liked how they designed the place, it looks cramped but when we sat down and played, it was really spacious and had a lot of room for our equipment.</em><br><strong>YooNgHwe'1:</strong> <em>There was a bit of stuttering due to the LAN setting, but that's something that professional gamers notice off the bat. It was something that many would miss, so it was good that we were the first to touch the games so that they know that it's something that would affect their customers' enjoyment in the future.</em>",

Every team has certain maps that they favor, so we tried our best to cover our bases by training on as many of the eligible maps as possible. This is so that we wouldn't be caught off-guard like we were last time.</em><br><strong>Y:</strong> <em>We also worked on strengthening our mental game. Trying to be more consistent and making fewer mistakes. Also trying our best to not let our mistakes get to us and get our heads back into the game quicker. Our coach, Aiman, helped us a lot in this regard. He kept drilling into us the right mindset that we should have.</em>",

I'm still the captain, but my responsibilities are mostly offscreen. I keep the team under control and make sure our group dynamic is solid and composed.</em>",

So the loss was the slap to the face we needed to get ourselves back on track.</em><br><strong>Y:</strong> <em>In the second round, I think we were more familiar with the map compared to Orange. And click- managed to make really good calls that caught them off guard and we managed to climb back. We just managed to play better on the day.</em>",
