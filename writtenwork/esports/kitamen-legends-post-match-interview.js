      "output": "Last weekend, our <em>Fire Dragoon</em> <em>FIFA 17</em> duo managed to emerge as the victors of the <em>Kitamen Legends FIFA 17</em> tournament, we sat down with them after the event to get their thoughts about being a professional gamer, life outside of gaming and the future of <em>FIFA 17</em>.",

      "output": "<strong>Congratulations on the one-two win. How did the tournament go?</strong><br><strong>AmTuah:</strong> <em>I felt that the tournament was a success. We really like how the organizers ran the event. It was very professional and they kept us on time. The turnout of players for the event was really good as well. It was almost full.</em><br><strong>Shige:</strong> <em>I agree, I really liked the equipment they provided, comfortable chairs, good monitors. I felt that I could just play and wasn't distracted by the environment around us.</em><br><strong>A:</strong> <em>I think most importantly is that they treated everyone the same. Whether you were a top tier player or you were just coming in to play for fun, we all felt looked after and the prize giving ceremony was even on the main stage showing us that the tournament was a big part of the event and not just an afterthought.</em>",

      "output": "<strong>How does it feel to be playing against each other in a tournament setting?</strong><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>There's definitely a different feeling compared to playing against another player from a different team. Although this game is more focused on individual players, we are still working together as a team to achieve our goals.</em><br><strong>A:</strong> <em>That's right. We actually feel less pressured because we felt that we've already achieved our target as a team to win the top prize. So it was actually quite fun in the end.</em>",

      "output": "<strong>For those who are following you two, it seems like you guys play a lot. How do you guys train every week?</strong><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>Our coach, Nidzam, schedules for us a schedule that we stick to and we also have our own allotted time to train the skills that we might feel that we are weak at. We do have our own style of training but because of the more structured </em><em>training,</em><em> we feel we learn a lot that we might not have noticed.</em><br><strong>A:</strong> <em>I agree. While I like to train with a fast counterattack style, by taking advantage of a failed attack on me. The more structured training that is provided here at Fire Dragoon helped me to improve much faster than I would have if I just played the Season mode on my own.</em>",
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "output": "<strong>What mode do you use to train, Shige?</strong><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>I personally prefer to play in the FIFA Ultimate Team mode. Because when I'm disadvantaged in terms of the players that I have compared to my opponent, then I have to use my skills to perform better instead.</em>",
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "output": "<strong>How do you balance work with personal life?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> <em>I think as a gamer, sometimes it's hard to have a balance. Because we're so passionate about the game that we want to play as much as possible. But I think what really helps me is that I have a very supportive girlfriend who would come to see all my matches even if I tell her that it might be boring. My friends are also very understanding that I'm a professional gamer they don't pressure me to always turn up for events because they know that I have to work on weekends.</em><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>My girlfriend is also very supportive, she understands what I'm doing as a career so she supports me fully. Sadly, she works weekends as well, so she doesn't get me to see me perform. So I try to make it up to her.</em>",
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "output": "<strong>Outside of games, do you guys hang out?</strong><br><strong>A:</strong> <em>I usually hang out with the Counter-Strike players because I stay with them. But we don't usually hang out cause we see each other so much during training.</em><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>We're good friends, it's just that I see him more than my girlfriend. I think I would slap Am if I see him any more than I do now.</em>",

    {
      "type": "text",
      "output": "<strong>It seems hectic having to play every weekend, do you feel stressed by having to perform at the last minute at times?</strong><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>We're actually very excited to play every week. Even if it's a small tournament, we love it because it gives us a chance to practice against live opponents. We get to try out the things that we practice and train for and also get used to the pressure of playing against a live opponent in front of a crowd.</em>",

      "output": "<strong>How's the FIFA 17 football scene in KL?</strong><br><strong>S:</strong><em> I think it's a growing scene in Malaysia. We see small kids as young as 10 joining tournaments. We're so happy seeing young and upcoming players because we love to see new talent doing well and challenging us.</em><br><strong>A:</strong><em> I think even if we don't hear much about FIFA here outside of the community like other esports games like Dota 2 and </em><em>CS:GO.</em><em> The community is growing, tournaments that we join would have like hundreds of players competing.</em>",
    },
    {
      "type": "text",
      "output": "<strong>Last question, what do you feel is the best way for people to get involved with the FIFA 17 community?</strong><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>There are so many ways that people and players can get involved with the game. We're kind of envious that Dota 2 and </em><em>CS:GO</em><em> get so many videos made about their gameplay by their fans. As players, we would love to see the fan community start creating videos and doing live streams for the game.</em><br><strong>A:</strong> <em>The community is very tight-knit, but we could do a better job supporting </em><em>the tournament organizers</em><em> by staying all the way until the end instead of leaving after being eliminated. We have to be more supportive of each other.</em><br><strong>S:</strong> <em>One more thing that we would love to have is more international events. Like Dota 2 has The Internationals and their MMR system. We would love to see FIFA be as big as Dota 2 someday.</em><em> EA has their FIFA Interactive World Cup and we would love to see it grow to be like TI in terms of popularity. But until then, we hope to see more people rising up in our community for competitions and to help build the community.</em>",
