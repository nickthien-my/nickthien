The qualifiers were held weeks before-hand so that players who qualified in West Malaysia would have enough time to settle their flights to Sabah.<br>The finals for FIFA17 consisted of two stages, the group stage and the elimination stage. The group stages had 4 groups of 8 players battling it out for the top 4 slots to be qualified for the next stage for a total of 16 qualified players.<br>These 16 players were then seeded into the elimination stage and from there they would play a best of 3 rounds to see who would emerge the champion. In the end, MyFes_Epiz, who started out in the same group as Shige, would be the one to beat as he dominated the group stage and the elimination stage to emerge the grand champion of the FIFA17 tournament.<br>Here's the breakdown of AmTuah and Shige's matches,"
