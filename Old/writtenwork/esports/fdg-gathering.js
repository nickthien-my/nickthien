      "output": "Last weekend we had a few representatives from Primal High Performance Consulting (PHP), a company specializing in consulting for sports athletes, to give our players a short introduction into sports psychology. There's a hesitation even to this day, to call esports, an actual category in the wider context of sports. And this isn't even only just from the general public's perspective, but from a player's perspective as well. Many times players would just consider what they are doing as playing games and from that a mindset would form that what their doing is just a game that there would be little to no stakes involved. But as esports starts to become more widely accepted worldwide as a form of competition. Games stop being just about the games and involve a whole lot more.<br>Hence, it was a good opportunity as we finalized the last of our team members to bring everyone together to set a clear goal for the company and the players. As an esports company, our main goal is to be competitive and to win games. But whether or not we do so convincingly is a different story. Results can only speak so much if on the surface everyone seems to get by the skin of their teeth. While it's good to be competent in game, it's also good to be confident and presentable off-screen as well. Making the jump from your bedrooms or the cyber cafe to the arenas and stadiums doesn't just mean playing the same game but in a different venue but a complete different playing field and rules.<br>Players are no longer competing only for themselves but for their respective teams and company, they now carry the burden of being the public face of not only the company but the sponsors and partners they represent. While some are able to weather the pressures of being in the public, many are not. Many are not regularly exposed to the limelight or have the training to be accustomed to it and this affects the performance of the players whether they realize it or not. Players choking at crucial moments that cost the team games. An inability to capitalize on a mistake that an opponent team made. Or a lack of focus and self-doubt as a player beat himself over an easy mistake that he's unable to recover from. A player could be in peak physical shape but a sharp and strong mind is what is required to win even against impossible odds.<br>It was enlightening as well as encouraging to hear from the PHP's representatives that they, as well as their peers in the field, have taken a serious interest in esports as a very viable industry. It not only helps us to reaffirm what we've known all along that we're working at the forefront of this industry but also gives us the confidence to continue to breaking new ground. A lot of blood, sweat and tears went into starting this company and it feels good to finally see the seeds that we've sewn come into fruition. In the end of the day, we're not doing all this for ourselves. While some might feel that a monopoly in this industry is good, competition is what brings out the best throughout the whole industry.<br>At the end of the day, with all the pomp and circumstances of a burgeoning industry. There's a risk of losing sight of what it's all about. Are we just another wannabe that's jumping on to the hype train or are we going to be a serious contender? Is our goal to chase the endorsements or selling merchandise? No, esports has to be about the competition and it's our jobs to help grow the industry so that there will always be fresh competition not only for us to compete with but for everyone out there to enjoy watching.",
