      "output": "Throughout human history, man has been obsessed with the \"chase\". Something that gives a man purpose and drive.<br><em>Dota 2</em>'s MatchMaking Rank (MMR) has been that purpose and drive for many players. A perfect convergence of obsession and technology. The additional inclusion of a leaderboard that tracks the players and provides a list of the highest ranked players in their respective region. This began a chase amongst millions of players to show that they are the best <em>Dota 2</em> player in their respective regions.<br>And one of those players who can boast being on top is Vincent \"AlaCrity\" Hiew Teck Yoong. Only 20 years old, the young Johorian managed to surpass the 9K milestone in early July 2017, and as of the time of writing is currently the second ranked player in the SEA division. And what keeps him going is the \"chase\".<br>Early on in his gaming career, the only thing in AlaCrity's sights was to enjoy the game. Content to play anywhere as long as he could play. This definitely informed his current playstyle as someone who takes risks, juking in and out of the opposing team's combat lines, surprising his enemies when a more conservative player would stay in their safe zones.<br>But things took a turn when Valve introduced their MMR system in early 2014, for a lot of people including AlaCrity, it changed the game from mere casual competition to actual numbers that showed how much better a player was to another. And this lit a fire within AlaCrity to be one of the best <em>Dota 2</em> players in Malaysia.<br>\"Having a higher MMR, gets you noticed by team scouts\" says AlaCrity as he recounts his time playing for professional teams in the past year. Names like Mineski-X, Mineski-MY and Napo are some of the team names that crosses his lips, some of the big name <em>Dota 2</em> teams here in Asia.<br>However, just having a desire to win is not enough for you to break through the 4K rank, much less the 5K and each subsequent rank after, as the higher you go the more skilled the players that you are matched up against become. AlaCrity continues to train every day, both in team games and solo queue. To him, it's his belief that \"talent doesn't make you a better player, it's hard work and consistency that makes you a better player.\" He enjoys playing the game even after playing professionally while many would feel burnt out due to the pressure.<br>\"There's a lot of pressure for me to improve, playing with players like Mushi taught me to thrive under pressure and to up my game.\" With newfound recognition from his peers, AlaCrity hasn't let it all go to his head. While there will be others who see him now as a potential target at tournaments and online. He is keeping his focus on one game at a time.<br>But he does express a desire not to be known as just a good solo player but as someone who is capable of winning titles with a team as well. With his eyes set on the next big regional tournament and one day competing on the big stage at The International. Outside of tournaments, his next personal achievement is to surpass fellow Malaysian <em>Dota 2</em> player and midlaner Zheng \"MidOne\" Yeik Nai, who in the same week of made news of passing the 10K MMR milestone. While he's enjoying the limelight that he's currently getting, what's important to him is what happens in-game. Reiterating that a high MMR doesn't really matter in the game if your team is not working well.<br>AlaCrity assures us, that he's not given up on his \"chase\" anytime soon. Whether it be the next 10K or for the next tournament win. What's important to him at the end of the day, is the \"chase\".",
