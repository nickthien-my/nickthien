      "output": "The <em>Fire Dragoon League of Legends</em> team managed to extend their winning streak up to 4 last weekend, going 2-0 against <em>Climax</em>. This win moved the team up one spot to the 3rd place with 7 points. With 3 matches remaining, the team's position in the quarterfinals is assured as long as they don't lose both of their matches this weekend.<br>Coming back after a long week, some might assume that the LoL team would be too complacent when they finally competed against Climax on Sunday. With the first game in FDG's pockets, many wondered if Climax would pull off what they've been doing against every team this season, even against 2nd placed team <em>Orange eSports</em>, which is to make a comeback during the 2nd match and tie against FDG. There was a heart-stopping moment when Climax managed to pull off the first Pentakill in <em>The Legends Circuit Malaysia 2017</em> group stage but FDG managed to keep their composure and clinched the win from Climax.",

      "output": "The <em>Fire Dragoon Overwatch</em> team had an busy week taking part in two events. One was <em>Jom Main! June 2017</em> by <em>Midnight Gaming</em> and the <em>Thai Dreamcasters Championship Season 2</em>. The team was sadly eliminated from both events. In the semi-finals for Jom Main! and the top 16 for Thai Dreamcasters. The common thread between them, they were both Singaporean teams.<br><em>Gam3.Avalon Aegis</em> was the roadblock to the OW's team progress during Jom Main! Letting their presence known to all teams as they went on to become the champions in the tournament in a convincing way. On the flip side, <em>Chaos Theory Orion</em> was the thorn to the OW team's side as they eliminated the team in the Top 16. The team managed to get into the top 16 out of 256 which is no small achievement. The Thai Dreamcaster season is still ongoing, so it remains to be seen how the rest of the rankings will turn out.",

It was a close match but sadly they couldn't overcome the Singaporean team going 14-16 against them.<br>Taking place a little closer to home, the team joined the <em>B5 Battle Arena CS:GO Online Qualifiers</em> hosted by <em>Orange eSports</em>. They made their way to the top 8 before they were knocked out by <em>Exodus Striatus</em>, another Singaporean team. Sadly, there was a technical issue which hampered the performance of the team.

Winning both of them at the top spot, he continues to show why he's one of the top <em>FIFA 17</em> player in Malaysia.<br><strong>Shige</strong><br>Taking place on Saturday as well was <em>ESL</em>'s <em>FIFA 1on1 PlayStation Plus Community Tournament #1 Asia</em>. Shige managed to get into the top 8 position before being eliminated from the tournament by a Hong Kong player whose PSN ID goes by <em>shingmanshing</em>.<br>Shige showing us that he can stand toe-to-toe with the international crowd is definitely something to be proud off regardless if he manages to win the tournament. Hopefully, we'll be able to see more public performances from Shige in the near future.",
