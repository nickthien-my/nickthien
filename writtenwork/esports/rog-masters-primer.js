Last year, Malaysia had the privilege of hosting the Grand Finals at the Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre but this weekend, the Malaysian teams will be kicking off their journey into the ROG Masters at 1Utama.<br>Here are some of the stories leading up to the tournament that you, the #FireNation should get to know before the battle starts.",

They have since undergone multiple roster swaps and has been on a hiatus.<br>However, having been under the radar since May 2017, it is definitely exciting to see what they can showcase in the tourney. Coach aimaNNN would probably be excited about this homecoming match, but due to how the brackets are allocated, it will only take place if both teams end up clashing against each other at the later stage of the tournament.",
