I've been involved with League of Legends specifically for 6 years now. I've been everything from a player, to a shoutcaster, to an analysis, a coach and now a manager. I was pretty good at League back in the day but I decided to focus on finishing my education before making a return to esports. But even after all this time I still have a love for esports in my heart.</em>",

I wasn't sure if working for a company here in Malaysia, I would be able to make as big of an impact as if I was somewhere else. There was a lot of convincing but I saw that FDG was doing all the right moves and felt that I could help out the League side of things and decided to give it a shot.</em><br><em>While my family supports my career choice, I still feel that there's a lot of improvements left to go for esports. We're still not at the point where it's a viable career that people still feel like it's taking a big risk to pursue a career in it. I want to continue paving the way so that the next person won't feel the need to ask himself or herself whether or not it's a risk to jump into the esports arena.</em>",

Once we're acquainted, then we start discussing where we plan on heading. I want to try and get everyone on the same page before moving forward. I want everyone to move in the same direction, vision, and goals. When everyone believes in the same vision, then everyone will pull their own weight and do their best.  To me what I feel my role as a manager is, it is to make sure that the team would be able to function without me.</em>",
