      "output": "The Fire Dragoon team took a break from competing last weekend to visit the picturesque landmarks of our northern brethren in Penang. The staff and several players were there to be a part of the <em>NVIDIA GeForce Day 2017</em>. The event was held at Penang's famous Hin Bus Depot in George Town.<br>The main hall of the depot was packed with excited fans waiting to see what <em>NVIDIA </em>had in store for them. <em>League of Legends</em>' Jonathan \"Xare\" Chan, <em>Defense of the Ancient 2</em>'s \"BrayaNt\" Pang Jian Zhe and <em>FIFA 17</em>'s Amirul \"AmTuah\" Afandi took to the stage not long after the introduction of the event to share their personal experiences as professional players.<br>The crowd was moved by the stories of the players' struggles to make it big in the field of esports, the players shared how it was not easy fighting their way in a growing industry. That it's as competitive in and out of the computer screen. But they still hope that their message could inspire others to stand firm in their dreams to pursue a career in the esports. The players ended this introductory session with a few Q&A questions from our <em>NVIDIA</em> hosts.<br>Later in the evening, our players Xare and AmTuah returned to the stage to provide commentary for LoL and FIFA 17 gameplay to give the crowd an idea how professionals players might look at the games differently compared to those who only played the games casually. efore the NVIDIA host would take over for the rest of the event for lucky draws but also for a very important announcement.<br>The <em>NVIDIA </em>host took a few minutes to bring everyone up to speed with their achievements and technical advancements before dropping the biggest news at the event which was that <em>NVIDIA </em>would be organizing the <em>GEFORCE Esports eXtreme Tournament (GEXT)</em>.<br><em>GEXT </em>is a <em>Dota 2</em> tournament organized by <em>NVIDIA </em>in collaboration with <em>GeForce Certified </em><em>iCafes</em> all throughout Western Malaysia. The tournament will start in early September 2017 and it will be eligible only to amateur players with a prize pool of Rm20,000 for the grand finals with the champions walking away with Rm10,000.<br>It is a concerted effort on <em>NVIDIA</em>'s part to help grow the esports industry here in Malaysia and <em>Fire Dragoon</em> is proud to be a supporter as we believe that we have a strong part to play in the growth of the industry whether it&rsquo;s through competing in events or by supporting the efforts of the esports industry around us to continue growing by attracting new players.<br>We'll be keeping a close eye on the tournament as we're excited to see the outcome of this new tournament and especially the influx of players who might be itching to try out their skills on each other not long after <em>Valve</em>'s <em>The International 17</em> tournament next month. If we're lucky, we might even get to see the rise of the next AlaCrity.",
